This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href="http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href="https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">submit it here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></i></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"WordPress 4.8.1 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/wordpress-4-8-1-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 21:26:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4875";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:366:"After over 13 million downloads of WordPress 4.8, we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of WordPress 4.8.1, a maintenance release.

Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress core’s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycle’s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core.

To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>. You can also visit <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">the project’s GitHub repository</a> to report issues and contribute to the codebase.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">Bridget Willard <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/21/proposed-wordcamp-editorial-calendar/">has proposed an editorial calendar</a> to assist WordCamp organizers with publishing content for their event.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">A new kind of niche WordCamp, <a href="https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp for Publishers in Denver</a>, has opened ticket sales.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">The WordPress iOS app was updated with <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/an-all-new-media-library-for-the-wordpress-ios-app/">a fresh, new media library</a> this month.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">It looks like <i>Underscores</i>, the popular WordPress starter theme, <a href="https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/">has a bright future ahead of it</a>, with a renewed vision and new committer.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">The always-inspiring Tom McFarlin <a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress">has released a simple autoloader for WordPress</a> that looks very useful indeed.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">After a bit of a discussion on Twitter regarding the differences between WordPress.org, WordPress.com, and Jetpack, <a href="https://helen.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/restaurant-vs-meal-kit-vs-grocery-shopping-or-wordpress-com-vs-jetpack-vs-wordpress-org/">Helen Hou-Sandí came up with a great analogy</a> and an interesting post about it all.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">If you’re interested in contributing specifically to the JavaScript or PHP areas of the WordPress core codebase, then the new #core-js and #core-php channels in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> are perfect for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please </i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i>submit it here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4865";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"WordPress 4.8 “Evans”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:49:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:373:"An Update with You in Mind Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8BDWH3QG-1-video" width="632" height="342" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world?

These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

I think it was a pre-owned old beaten Compaq Deskpro 386. We only stopped arguing once we could sit down together and play Civ; one of us at the controls, the others giving advice on what moves to make.</p>\n<h3>Dipping Into The Web</h3>\n<p>I learnt HTML and built my first pages on Geocities and out of necessity: I needed a place to publish my angsty teenage poetry. But people didn’t come to my website for the bad poetry, instead they filled my guestbook with webdesign and HTML questions.</p>\n<p>I have built websites for myself and others since the mid 90’s and kept a few clients on the side while studying. At this time, there was not a lot of computer or programming classes available for high school students. It had been easy enough to learn HTML online by reading guides, message boards and similar. During one of my final semesters, my school announced a new class called “Computers for girls”. I signed up hoping to learn enough to assemble or upgrade my own PC. The class was a joke. Instead of teaching us about motherboards, memory or networks, our teacher showed us where to put the cords…</p>\n<p>He didn’t realise that most of us already spent every recess in the computer halls, chatting over IRC. In order to learn the basics of actual programming (not just HTML), I had to take adult education evening- and summer classes since my school didn’t offer any.</p>\n<h3>Derailed</h3>\n<p>After high school I did like many others of my generation: I fell in love with someone I had only met online, who lived on the other side of the world. All to the soundtrack of Savage Garden&#8217;s “I Knew I Loved You”.</p>\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>\n<p>It took all my savings and courage to travel back and forward between Sweden and the US, while studying from a distance.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When my boyfriend suddenly passed away in 2001 I had to make drastic changes in my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was in the middle of moving, I couldn’t keep up with deadlines or deal with clients, and I was barely able to finish my project managing and programming classes. I had to forget all our plans, start over, and take a desk job instead.</p>\n<h3>Coming Back To The Web</h3>\n<p>Many years later one of my former clients asked if I had tried WordPress. It took me a few months to decide if I liked it or not, partially because I didn’t know PHP, and because I didn’t have great experiences from trying Joomla and Drupal.</p>\n<p>I did some customization work and eventually I submitted my first theme to WordPress.org. Of course my theme was a mess and did not even work as expected.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I appreciated that someone took the time to look at my code and explain what I needed to do to fix it and where I could read more. It was very rare to receive such feedback.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I joined the Theme Review Team&#8217;s mailing list, listening in and learning. I started reviewing themes to learn more and to improve my own themes.</p>\n<p>For those who do not know what the Theme Review Team does, we test and review the code (every single file) of themes that are submitted to be included in the WordPress.org theme directory.</p>\n<h3>My Secret Power</h3>\n<p>Because I am on the autism spectrum, the structure and patterns of coding languages suits me well. I need both structure and a creative outlet in my life, and coding is therapy, much like a puzzle or a coloring book. I love my once dreaded desk job, because it gives me the opportunity to help people on a different scale than I ever could as a freelancer. Being a volunteer on WordPress.org lets me combine both worlds.</p>\n<p>I could never have imagined that WordPress would become an important part of my life, that I would spend this much time on it (sometimes up to 20 hours per week), or that I would be asked to be one of the team leads for the Theme Review Team in 2017.</p>\n<p>Today I honestly don’t know what I would do if I could no longer contribute to WordPress the way I know and am familiar with. It is an essential part of my everyday life.</p>\n<p>WordPress is also challenging because you can only do so much without interacting with others… And even though I find that difficult, I have had to learn that it is something I need as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have to remind myself from time to time that here, I am allowed to be myself, with all my flaws, to contribute as much or as little as I choose, at my own pace.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And to be able to contribute and to help others, I also have to remind myself that people are not scary.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>I was a volunteer online for 6 years before I had the courage to go to my first WordCamp, which took place in my own home town. When I was finally there, I only spoke to 3 or 4 people. My second WordCamp went better, but the experience was still overwhelming.</p>\n<p>During my third WordCamp, which was WCEU 2017, I helped lead the Theme Review section of the contributor day, having to speak in front of 500 people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The thing is, even when it overwhelms you, this community and its energy is addicting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Everything changes once you go to your first meetup or WordCamp, meeting people who share your interest and passion. The community at large is open and welcoming, passionate, curious and caring. And it is trying to be a safe place for us all.</p>\n<h3>The Theme Review Team</h3>\n<p>There always seem to be a lot of opinions and even controversy surrounding the Theme Review Team. It is not always easy to handle the pressure and the amount of responsibility that is placed on you because so many people have a financial interest in WordPress themes. As a team lead or moderator, you often have to try to find the least bad solution to many different kind of situations.</p>\n<p>By the end of September, it is time for the current team leads to step back and welcome our next leads. I am looking forward to the break, but also to see what new ideas they will bring.<br />\nIt takes time to change a system that has been in place for this many years, and truthfully, sometimes it is painfully slow. It has proven difficult to find a system where themes without errors can be added to the directory quickly, and where reviewers can support authors who need extra help.</p>\n<p>This amazing team of volunteers has managed to reduce the queue time from 7 months down to 8-10 weeks.

The discussion focused less on specific framework comparisons and more on the role a framework will play in building JavaScript-powered interfaces for WordPress. Contributors were joined by core developers and leaders from the React and Vue communities, Chrome engineers, and other interested parties from outside the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This chat will focus largely on identifying requirements in building core features, overlap with plugin and theme authors, and patterns to reducing framework lock-in,&#8221; Duthie said. &#8220;Ideally this is higher-level than simply debating the merits of specific frameworks in a vacuum, and should be seen as an opportunity to collaborate between projects to set a path forward for WordPress which will provide flexibility and resiliency to future churn.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Duthie began by asking what role a framework should play in a WordPress developer&#8217;s workflow and also asked framework contributors to offer their perspectives on recommendations for extendable interfaces. This question provided attendees with the opportunity to weigh in on topics such as <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2791" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support for web components</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">framework-agnostic block interoperability</a> for Gutenberg, and how this might affect WordPress&#8217; plugin ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I disagree a bit with the idea that whatever core (in this case Gutenberg) uses to power some of the intricacies of building a stateful app is going to be the de facto standard for plugin development,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Matías Ventura said. &#8220;The actual framework here, in general terms, is going to be what WordPress exposes and the APIs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks, the library that core decides to build on doesn&#8217;t have to become the de facto standard for plugin developers but many outside the Gutenberg team believe that it will inevitably end up that way in practice. There are entire teams of engineers waiting on this decision that are committed to adopt whichever framework WordPress bets on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To provide some perspective on how WP’s decision on a framework impacts developers downstream, I’m a developer at Boston University and our plan is to focus on whichever framework WP decides upon, even if Gutenberg has a completely agnostic API,&#8221; Adam Pieniazek said. &#8220;We’re primarily a WP shop (~ 1,000 site WP install powers most/a lot of our public web presence) and end up creating huge customizations on top of WP that often require diving into core to see what is actually happening in the background. I like Vue more than React personally, but if WP decides upon React, BU will focus on building expertise in React for when we need to peek/debug beyond the API. It doesn’t mean we won’t also use Vue but it won’t be our primary focus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pieniazek feedback echoes that of Gravity Forms co-founder Carl Hancock, who said his team is ready to adopt whatever library WordPress selects.</p>\n<p>“People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,” Hancock said in the #core-js channel earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Many participants from outside the WordPress community seemed to be in agreement with a framework-agnostic approach and none were eager to force a single framework on all developers working with WordPress. The remaining concern is how this works out practically and whether it puts developers in the confusing position of using a framework on top of a framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since Gutenberg itself is going to become a platform to build for, the best level of separation is if the framework is used to build the core, but isn’t exposed as API to block builders,&#8221; AMP engineer Paul Bakaus said. &#8220;This gives one the choice to replace the underlying foundation whenever necessary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella summarized the approach the team has been discussing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think what we try to communicate is something like:</p>\n<p>&#8211; WordPress Core is going to use this X framework internally<br />\n &#8211; If you want to use it, we think it’s good<br />\n &#8211; If you want to usee something else, you can just as easily as you’d use the Core’s chosen framework</p></blockquote>\n<p>Benguella also said that one of the goals for Gutenberg is &#8220;to set the basis for how we extend WordPress&#8217; UI in the future.&#8221; Once it ships, the team will likely set its sights on other parts of the wp-admin and build them in the same way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If all parts of WP’s UI can be extended via a standard interface, whether it be a simple &#8216;data down, events up&#8217; API, or expecting a WC, I think this would cleanly separate the concerns of &#8216;what framework to use for core&#8217; vs. &#8216;what framework to use for extension development,''&#8221; Vue.js creator Evan You said.</p>\n<p>When asked for his thoughts on on React becoming a primary framework for WordPress, React maintainer Dan Abromov was hesitant to advocate for WordPress adopting the library. His response underscored the necessity of having a framework-agnostic approach for extending Gutenberg and future WP interface overhauls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know WordPress well, so it&#8217;s hard for me to say whether it&#8217;s a great fit for the use case or not,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;Generally we use React for highly interactive UIs and find that it scales well with the app size. I&#8217;m also happy to answer technical questions about it. But I think in general people have strong opinions about, for example, templating vs expressiveness, and I don&#8217;t feel like forcing React upon everyone is the best way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also feel the same way,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;Forcing a single framework on everyone, regardless of which one, is IMO not a good idea because it is bound to alienate the group of devs who are not into that framework, and imposes a bigger long term stability risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also said that people are already &#8220;very bitter and divisive&#8221; about the subject of selecting a framework. He also tweeted a similar sentiment prior to the meeting.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I read discussion threads (e.g. about WordPress) there’s a sense that people perceive every team as hostile to others.

It’s just a matter of proper implementation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants referenced <a href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">custom-elements-everywhere.com</a>, a site that displays popular JS frameworks&#8217; progress on communicating Custom Elements in a way that promotes interoperability. Matías Ventura asked React and Vue core devs how web components (and their future) fit into each framework at the moment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In React, we have some web component support but haven&#8217;t made it a large priority since use cases have seemed slim in the past, especially since adding Web Components hasn&#8217;t made a lot of sense in a first-party application where you control the whole stack – but we do have some support for them nonetheless and I&#8217;m happy to entertain adding more, either now or in the future,&#8221; Sophie Alpert said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the high level I think frameworks like React/Vue provide what is not really addressed in web components: efficient and declarative DOM updates reacting to state changes,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;This is also why Polymer exists on top of WC. I have always acknowledged the value of WC as an interop interface.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Overall, attendees at the meeting were respectful, collaborative, and eager to contribute their expertise to help WordPress contributors find the best way forward in the framework selection process. The discussion will continue at next week&#8217;s meeting and likely in the comments of a forthcoming Make/Core post summarizing the meeting.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 22:16:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Spam Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75059";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"https://wptavern.com/si-captcha-anti-spam-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-og-due-to-spam-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4092:"<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam</a> plugin has been removed from the WordPress Directory due to its author including spam code. The plugin added a CAPTCHA image test to WordPress forms to prevent spam and was compatible with forms generated by bbPress, BuddyPress, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. It had more than 300,000 active installs at the time of removal.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikechallis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mike Challis</a>, the original author of the plugin, said that a WordPress.org user named &#8220;<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/fastsecure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fastsecure</a>&#8221; became the new owner of SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam in June 2017. Challis was not aware of the new owner&#8217;s plans for the plugin but <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted a notice</a> on the WordPress.org support forums to inform users about why it was removed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new owner attempted to put code in several of his newly acquired WordPress plugins that would connect to a 3rd party server he also owned and place spam ads for payday loans and such in the WP posts,&#8221; Challis said. He also linked the incident to a ring of WordPress plugins that researchers at Wordfence say were part of a <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/09/coordinated-plugin-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">coordinated spam campaign</a>. Display Widgets, one of the most notable plugins in this group, was recently <a href="https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code" rel="noopener" target="_blank">permanently removed from WordPress.org</a> for a series of violations wherein the author had injected malicious code.</p>\n<p>Challis said the new owner failed to display any spam on sites due to how the code was implemented, but the code could have been activated at a later time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The new owner put spam code in versions 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 but it failed to display any spam because he put the code in the secureimage.php file. The malicious code required WordPress libraries to also be loaded to execute. The reason the spam code did not do anything at all is because the secureimage.php file is not included in the WordPress run time environment. The secureimage.php file is included from another file securimage_show.php that loads the captcha image directly from html img src outside of the WordPress run time. The spam code in this plugin was never activated, it would not have corrupted your posts or changed anything in the WordPress database.</p></blockquote>\n<p>SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam users who still have the plugin installed may see an update available in the WordPress admin. Plugin team member Samuel (Otto) Wood removed the malicious code and <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released 3.0.3</a> as a clean version that is a safe update for users who still rely on the plugin. Wood recommends users find an alternative, because SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam will not be re-listed in the directory or receive any future updates.</p>\n<p>The incident is another reminder for users to be on alert when WordPress.org plugins change hands, as the buyers do not always disclose their actual intentions for the plugin.

React community members began rallying around a <a href="https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">petition to re-license React</a> after the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) added Facebook’s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses for Apache PMC members. Facebook’s engineering directors officially denied the request in mid-August, citing the burden of meritless patent litigation as the reason for keeping the patents clause.</p>\n<p>Facebook moved forward on this decision in full recognition that it might lose some React community members as a consequence. Many open source project maintainers began to look for alternatives. In a surprising move, Matt Mullenweg announced that <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WordPress would also be parting ways with React</a> and planned to remove it from the upcoming Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s decision to drop React from consideration for WordPress was likely an influential factor in Facebook&#8217;s eventual about-face on the topic of re-licensing the project. Facebook&#8217;s announcement on Friday acknowledges that the company failed to convince the open source community of the benefits of its BSD + Patents license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re relicensing these projects because React is the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source software for the web, and we don&#8217;t want to hold back forward progress for nontechnical reasons. </p>\n<p>This decision comes after several weeks of disappointment and uncertainty for our community. Although we still believe our BSD + Patents license provides some benefits to users of our projects, we acknowledge that we failed to decisively convince this community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The React 16 release, slated for this week, will ship with the updated MIT license. Facebook declined to respond to our request for further comment and said their post is the only public statement they will be providing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear whether WordPress will continue on with React, picking up where the team left off on Gutenberg, or  shift to another library. Core contributors had originally <a href="https://twitter.com/nacin/status/911356481936740352" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decided on React</a> while attending WordPress&#8217; community summit in Paris last June, although this decision had not yet been made public when the greater open source community started petitioning Facebook to re-license React.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m just so tired of this drama,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella said. &#8220;We spent days and days thinking about the best framework for WP, and this change will just add more thinking, complexity, and uncertainty to our decision. I’m just tired of all this&#8230;we all have to rethink everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg, who had previously penned a several-thousand word unpublished announcement about how WordPress would be adopting React, did not confirm whether WordPress is still examining other libraries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our decision to move away from React, based on their previous stance, has sparked a lot of interesting discussions in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/09/facebook-dropping-patent-clause/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> published to his blog this weekend. &#8220;Particularly with Gutenberg there may be an approach that allows developers to write Gutenberg blocks (Gutenblocks) in the library of their choice including Preact, Polymer, or Vue, and now React could be an officially-supported option as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The regularly scheduled core JavaScript meeting is set for Tuesday, September 26 at 15:00 GMT and contributors plan to discuss the role a JS framework will play in current and future core focuses.

I watched a presentation where the presenter had slides with 20+ different recommended tools on them, and not a single mention of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an eCommerce conference, WooCommerce is 41% of all eCommerce stores, and not a single person said the word WooCommerce. All I heard about was Shopify and Amazon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to <a href="https://www.similartech.com/">SimilarTech</a>, WooCommerce is leading in the top 100K sites, top 1M sites, and the entire web while Shopify is leading in the top 10K sites. While Shopify has a lot less market share, it&#8217;s used on substantially higher trafficked sites.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared the perspective of a friend who uses Shopify to sell clothing and will gross more than $1M in revenue this year. According to his friend, Shopify is easy to use, from setting up a theme, to the plugin/app ecosystem to add functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When my friend said Shopify is easy to use, this is a whole different category of great user experience,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;This is building a site from scratch for a completely non-technical user, and them loving the end result and the experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bolinger raised an interesting point in that, Wix, Shopify, and SquareSpace are closed, SaaS offerings where they can control the user experience from end-to-end. This is impossible to do with WordPress because there are too many moving parts and core can not control how plugins and themes take part in that experience.</p>\n<p>While WordPress core can&#8217;t necessarily solve the problem, it hasn&#8217;t stopped webhosts from trying. <a href="https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-new-onboarding-experience-for-wordpress-customers">GoDaddy</a>,  <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/blog/bluehost-news/welcome-to-the-new-bluehost-8973/">Bluehost</a>, and others have created onboarding solutions that try to control the end-to-end user experience.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared a sentiment that many in the WordPress community have advocated in recent years. &#8220;If we’re honest, the strength of WordPress is not that it’s easy to use for non-technical people. It’s an open-source platform that is easy for developers to extend and customize for clients.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://mattreport.com/wordpress-is-not-easy/">WordPress is Not Easy</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://mor10.com/wordpress-easy-thats-ok/">WordPress is not easy – and that’s OK</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://neliosoftware.com/blog/is-wordpress-as-easy-as-we-think/">Is WordPress As Easy As We Think?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There was a time, somewhere between WordPress 2.3 and WordPress 3.5, where one of the main reasons people used WordPress was because it was easy. Between then and now, what caused WordPress to lose its ease-of-use factor?</p>\n<p>SquareSpace, Wix, and Shopify didn&#8217;t exist in the early days of WordPress, they were late to market. This gave them the advantage of implementing all the lessons learned through WordPress&#8217; lifespan and since it&#8217;s a closed system, they can iterate rapidly.</p>\n<p>The biggest reality check that Bolinger shares is that there are a lot of people WordPress simply doesn&#8217;t cater too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is a large contingent of people who just want to get stuff done, they don’t want to fuss with the tech&#8221;, He said. &#8220;They don’t care about open source or owning their data. They don’t want to install a theme and setup their widgets, or search thousands of results to find the best SEO plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They don’t want to set up &#8216;managed hosting&#8217;, an SSL certificate, or a payment gateway.

One of the more recent topics is the possibility of <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">framework-agnostic block rendering</a> for Gutenberg, which would allow developers to extend the new editor using any JS library they prefer. This means that Gutenberg blocks, which are colloquially referred to as &#8220;Gutenblocks,&#8221; could be built with Vue, React, Preact, Angular, or whatever the developer feels comfortable using.</p>\n<p>Proponents of this idea contend that pursuing a more flexible approach makes WordPress&#8217; core JS framework decision <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463#issuecomment-330637007" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less critical</a>. While answering questions on the #core-js channel, Gary Pendergast explained how Gutenberg could be built to maintain the separation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really not joking when I say that this decision doesn&#8217;t matter, even for people contributing to Gutenberg,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;In <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#2463</a>, the library is treated entirely as a utility library, much like we use lodash, for example. It performs a handful of tasks, and it can be relatively easily pulled out and replaced with something entirely different, with no disruption to the rest of the codebase. For people contributing to Gutenberg, they&#8217;re contributing in the Gutenberg coding style, not the style of whatever library we happen to import.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked about a timeline for when the decision will be made and what factors are being considered, Pendergast replied that there is no timeline and that those interested in participating should blog about their experiences and write examples of things they can build with the JS frameworks they are familiar with.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is neither roadmap, nor timeline, nor does there need to be,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;As Matt mentioned, it&#8217;s really just a technical decision &#8211; the important decision for the wider community was choosing &#8216;not React.&#8217; Unfortunately, this decision has been blown way out of proportion, and heavily conflated with &#8216;what JS library will I be able to build my plugins with?&#8217; and sometimes &#8216;what JS library&#8217;s practices will Gutenberg blocks resemble?,&#8217; neither of which are related. Tweets and posts that treat it like a horse race are not helpful in this way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast said whatever library is selected will &#8220;continue to be wrapped by the WordPress element, the underlying library won&#8217;t be exposed.&#8221; The Gutenberg team is working to remove all library dependencies from its components so that plugin developers can use any library they choose.</p>\n<p>However, other community members are not so eager to relegate the JS library selected for core to a simple technical decision or utility library.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most developers understand that their plugins are not bound by the framework chosen for core/Gutenberg,&#8221; Kevin Hoffman said. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t diminish the significance of the decision. If we want to encourage more contributors, we&#8217;d be well served to choose a framework in which a significant majority feel capable and confident. If this majority is out there developing plugins with one framework and has to learn another in order to contribute to core, then we&#8217;re limiting the number of potential contributors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Peter Booker contends that no matter how elegant Gutenberg&#8217;s separation is, having a decent understanding of the library chosen for core affects a developers&#8217; ability to deeply troubleshoot certain issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do not think we should be so dismissive of the choice as a minor technical decision,&#8221; Booker said. &#8220;Understanding how PHP, JavaScript, and Backbone (among other things) work is essential to be able to properly debug problems with WordPress. The JS framework chosen for Gutenberg is going to impact a great many people, even if we are not core contributors. It will be essential knowledge to be able to fully troubleshoot issues. This is a decision which will impact far more people than just the Gutenberg team.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What are the implications of providing a flexible, framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks?</h3>\n<p>Jason Bahl asked if anyone has tried mixing React, Preact, Vue, and Angular in a single app to see if it is &#8220;a recipe for a performance nightmare.&#8221; He posed an example scenario wherein Gravity Forms builds Vue-based Gutenblocks, Yoast has React-based blocks, WooCommerce builds blocks with Preact, and another plugin uses Ember.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It sounds kind of nice to be flexible and allow folks to use whatever but also like it could lead to a lot of division on best practices, and potentially performance issues,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see tutorials pop up for how to build Gutenblocks in Vue, React, Preact, Ember, Vanilla JS, etc., which would be cool to see, but also confusing and potentially cause further divide in the community and accepted best practices. Flexibility is nice to a degree, but a strong opinion at some level is also good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Carl Hancock, co-founder of Gravity Forms, contends that offering a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks will have little influence on developers who are extending the project. The decision cannot be made less critical by offering more flexibility, because developers will inevitably adopt whatever WordPress core uses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;Which means however complex that core framework ends up being will have a direct impact on the barrier to entry for plugin and theme developers. That barrier to entry has been historically low to date and a direct contributor to the growth of WordPress as a self-hosted CMS. Dramatically raising that barrier to entry isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For example, Gravity Forms will use Preact, Vue, whatever, because we have the manpower and skillset to do so when we can finally decide to do so once core makes it’s decision.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217; Opportunity to Advance the Web</h3>\n<p>WordPress currently powers 28% of all websites, according to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" rel="noopener" target="_blank">W3 Techs</a>, and whatever framework it chooses will make a major impact on which library many developers decide to learn in order to extend the software and advance their careers.</p>\n<p>Matías Ventura, one of the technical leads on the Gutenberg project, encouraged participants in the discussion to look at the bigger picture and embrace the opportunity to work together and collaborate on a solution for WordPress that will advance the web. The team&#8217;s efforts to collaborate with representatives from competing frameworks stands apart in an ecosystem that is generally fragmented and fractious.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m excited about the opportunity we have to advance web development in terms of JavaScript UI representation, in a similar way to how WordPress was a driving force for web standards during the past decade,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;That’s also where I see us having a responsibility as a project, as people will continue to learn web development through WP. Many people have been introduced to PHP through WordPress, originally just interacting with WP functions and APIs, eventually diving a bit more deeply into the language as needed. I do see our core remaining close to JS the language, as that gives the most meaningful tool to learn, spanning across all frameworks and libraries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura assured participants in the ongoing discussion that the Gutenberg team is listening and working towards a solution that will push the web forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are absolutely aware that how we build and what we offer through Gutenberg is going to affect the dev community and we are not taking this lightly—quite the opposite,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;I’ve been talking with Evan (Vue) and Jason (Preact) because rather than having a &#8216;choose your framework&#8217; contest, this seems an opportunity to collaborate and push the web forwards.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 22:26:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"WPTavern: DonateWC Reaches Fundraising Goal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75001";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"https://wptavern.com/donatewc-reaches-fundraising-goal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1702:"<p><a href="https://donatewc.org/">DonateWC</a>, <a href="https://wptavern.com/donatewc-aims-to-provide-travel-sponsorships-to-attend-large-wordcamps">an initiative</a> focused on providing less fortunate people an opportunity to attend large WordCamps has <a href="https://donatewc.org/news/surprise-our-goal-is-fully-funded/">reached its fundraising goal</a> of 1,000€.

The event was designed for people who use WordPress to manage publications and also to encourage collaboration among project maintainers who build open source tools for publishers.</p>\n<p>In addition to hands-on technical workshops, the <a href="https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/schedule/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">schedule</a> included a variety of publishing-related topics, such as monetization, content distribution, newsletter tools, and print and digital workflows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The schedule prompted a great deal of learning and discussion that extended well beyond the content typically found at a regional WordCamp,&#8221; attendee Maura Teal <a href="https://mlteal.com/2017/08/wordcamp-publishers-denver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;One of the best aspects of this conference was chatting with other developers and leaders involved in media on the web. There were multiple sessions and hallway discussions that brought intriguing solutions to the table. My primary takeaway was that there certainly needs to be more WordCamps of this kind &#8211; that is, focused on a niche but still rooted in community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The unique format of the event offered more small group opportunities than a traditional WordCamp does for learning, asking questions, and collaborating around tools and strategies that directly relate to publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp for Publishers was not your average or typical WordCamp,&#8221; attendee Dwayne McDaniel <a href="https://www.mcdwayne.com/2017/08/21/wordcamp-for-publishers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;It felt a lot more like WPCampus insofar as the general mood and feeling I got from the participants. Getting to see folks from competing media companies openly discussing how to solve their common challenges, I learned a whole lot and I am grateful to have had the chance to learn about the publishing space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Videos for all of the sessions held in the auditorium are now available in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4P7UHKK-kC1CGF3LDtfPDwtLEzDKiP9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube playlist</a>.

WordPress 4.8 added the new audio, image, and video widgets from this feature plugin. The gallery widget is targeted for merge into the upcoming WordPress 4.9 release.</p>\n<p>In testing the new feature I found it to be a simple, straightforward implementation of a gallery widget that could easily replace many plugins that are currently filling this need for users. The option to edit or replace a gallery is immediately available and users can easily rearrange or randomize the images included.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/core-gallery-widget.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>On the frontend the gallery displays neatly in a thumbnail grid. I was able to change the number of columns while editing the gallery, but the preview in the admin did not match the the way the gallery looks on the frontend. The number of columns is correct on the frontend but not in the admin preview. This might cause some confusion for users if it isn&#8217;t fixed before landing in core. Contributors to the plugin are looking at this <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/issues/190#issuecomment-331011895" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issue</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-20-at-3.16.22-PM-e1505938641908.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Overall, the implementation is user-friendly and similar to adding galleries in posts and pages. However, the widget could still use some testing, especially with different plugins installed. For example, with Jetpack enabled, users can choose between a thumbnail and a slideshow gallery, but the slideshow option doesn&#8217;t seem to work correctly in the widget. WordPress.org has <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/gallery+widget/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">several hundred plugins</a> that implement some sort of gallery widget and these plugin authors will want to test the new core widget.</p>\n<p>Theme authors will also need to test how the core gallery widget interacts with their themes. After testing the gallery widget with several popular WordPress.org themes, I found that many display the thumbnails with unsightly outlines and unpredictable spacing between images.</p>\n<p>Weston Ruter, who authored the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dev note post</a> when the previous media widgets were introduced in 4.8, said that the paragraph regarding default theme updates is still applicable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Themes that add custom styles to the MediaElement.js player (namely Twenty Thirteen and Twenty Fourteen) were updated from just styling it within syndicated content, to also include instances within widgets. Most themes don’t restrict styles for captioned images or media players to just post content, that is, limit CSS selectors to classes output by post_class(). If your theme does, make sure to either remove that constraint or include a .widget selector.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ruter said another dev note will be coming with common theme changes that are required to add the right styling for galleries. Users and theme/plugin developers can test the gallery widget right now on 4.8.2 or 4.9-alpha using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin. Once the widget is added to WordPress, it will be deactivated in the feature plugin for future releases. Contributors plan to merge the new widget into core next week, provided testing goes well.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 00:35:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 288 – No React.js Framework for Gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=74933&preview=true&preview_id=74933";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-288-no-react-js-framework-for-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3046:"<p>While I was supposed to be on vacation last week, I instead had surgery for a broken ankle.

I had become a part of something bigger than myself." /><p>The first time I ever made a WordPress site, I got 180,000 views in 2 days, 253 comments, and (give or take) 7 death threats.</p>\n<p>It was 2014 and I was working on an MBA at Florida State University during the peak of the Jameis Winston controversy, where a football quarterback was accused of rape and protected from prosecution by the university and local police. I had used WordPress before, but not a lot. But, in true democratizing publishing, giving a voice to the voiceless fashion, when I had something I wanted to say, I knew just the thing to get it out there with minimal know-how: a free, single page WordPress.com site.</p>\n<p>I had just returned to Florida from a summer in New York City. To my amazement, I got the life-changing opportunity, paid for by the university’s College of Social Sciences paid, to go up there for a summer of exploration in the social entrepreneurship and technology circles after pitching Florida State on a concept for financial education.</p>\n<h3>Beginning the Journey</h3>\n<p>I had become interested in financial education around the age of 16, when my family became homeless for a month. My mom hadn’t been able to make the rent, so we got kicked out, and then couldn’t find an apartment easily due to my mom’s lack of credit. Later, I started working at a major commercial bank and met hundreds, if not thousands, of people in similar situations (and saw the ways in which major commercial banks don’t help these people, but that’s a different conversation).</p>\n<p>Imagine having been homeless at 16. Then, 6 years later, you’re attending graduate school, funded by the university, and that same university also paid for you to live in the country’s most expensive place for 3 months so that you could learn about executing your ideas on how to make a positive difference through technology entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>You would probably be overcome with gratefulness. But you would also likely be extremely protective of the people making such a thing possible.</p>\n<p>Now imagine, that while Florida State University’s programs making such an impact on you, a football player’s actions are driving the narrative of this place you want to be proud of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine me, telling the story I just told you, and watching people connect the dots between what institution was making all of this possible for me, and what they had heard of it. “Oh, my God, with the quarterback that raped that girl?” they would say.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would link you to the page I created, but quite honestly, it wasn’t a lot more than a profanity-laden rant (of admittedly epic proportions). But, it got a reaction: she needs to shut the f**k up. She’s completely right. She’s an “attention-seeking whore!”. She’s the story we should be focusing on. She’s just upset her Kickstarter campaign failed.</p>\n<p>There it was: WordPress had amplified my voice, and everyone else’s, too.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress Business</h3>\n<p>Today, I’m the lesser-known half of Caldera Labs, makers of Caldera Forms, a top drag-and-drop form building plugin for WordPress. A few weeks ago, we got a one-star review on WordPress.org that called me out by name: “their team is useless, especially Christie Chirinos.” I received caring notes from several seasoned WordPress product developers, reassuring me that these things happen and I ought to not take it personally. “It’s not the first time someone’s been mean to me on the internet, and it probably won’t be the last,” I wrote in a Slack DM to my incredible business partner, the part of Caldera Labs you probably know, Josh Pollock. Josh laughed.</p>\n<p>My road from single-page rants on WordPress.com to WordPress product leadership was actually pretty straightforward, although certainly wrapped in incredible fortune. I kept up that blog for a few months at the request of some of those 253 people (and the dismay of some others). Eventually it was forgotten for my financial education project’s website, which went from Wix to self-hosted WordPress.</p>\n<p>Some months of working on that site made me acutely aware that if I wanted to execute more of my ideas, I should learn more code. I started learning JavaScript and PHP. I met Josh somewhere around that time. He liked my WordPress.com story, and encouraged me to keep learning, while picking my brain on what my almost-finished MBA thought about Caldera Forms.</p>\n<p>A professor asked me if I would work on his academic WordPress website for a fee. I was a broke graduate student, so I said yes. Suddenly I had clients. When I graduated, Josh approached me with a proposal to join him in business. I said yes, but my only condition is that I’m moving back to New York City. Josh said, remote work is the norm.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2118" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen_shot_2017-09-19_at_8.26.20_pm-1024x374.png" alt="Screen shot of Caldera website" width="960" height="351" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the quote-unquote “formal business education,” I was flabbergasted when the full weight of what a WordPress product business entailed hit me. I didn’t understand the community. I didn’t understand the niche’s culture. Much of what I learned were business norms, were completely non-existent in WordPress. I communicated all of this to Josh.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I have no idea what I’m doing.”</p>\n<p>“Of course you don’t, you’ve never done this before.”</p>\n<p>He introduced me to the extensive library of talks on WordPress TV on imposter syndrome.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Diving Into WordCamp</h3>\n<p>For me, it clicked at the inaugural WordCamp US. I showed up to the event looking like a deer caught in the headlights and was welcomed with open arms. I got to put faces to all of the names I had learned in the last half-year, and surprise: they were nice. They were welcoming. They were understanding.</p>\n<p>I scoffed at the idea that I would have anything to contribute on Contributor Day, and then found out that the polyglots team could totally use an immigrant that speaks 4 languages. More importantly, I became completely inspired by the mission of WordPress. I realized that, by total accident (or perhaps completely on purpose), I had become a part of something bigger than myself. I had to stick with it, no matter how hard it was.</p>\n<p>In the year after that, I also began to find a small niche for myself. I became “the girl with the MBA,” smart, young, and clearly lucky. “There’s not a lot of people in the space with your background,” said the host interviewing me on a WordPress podcast. Meanwhile, I’m thinking to myself, “oh my god. I don’t even understand why you invited me. I’m very grateful, but I also really don’t know that much about business. Didn’t you notice? Didn’t anyone tell you?”</p>\n<p>Move forward a year, and results started rolling in. I spoke at 4 WordCamps and many other shows. Josh published his 2016 Year In Review, where he outlined the explosive growth that Caldera Forms experienced at the end of the year and acknowledged the benefit of having partnered with me. He doesn’t know this, but I cried when I read that (now he knows).</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was surreal: the unlikely thing that we set out to do was working.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This year, 2017, has consisted of taking on the next step in that process: teaching myself how to turn all of those thoughts on their heads. I have had to unlearn “why me?” and internalize “why not me?”, and most importantly, practice differentiating the story that I tell myself about myself versus the evidence-based reality.</p>\n<h3>Self Discovery</h3>\n<p>A crucial part of this stage has been learning that what I do does not define who I am. That’s a tired joke where I live. The joke goes that you can go to any bar, and participate in the same script: what’s your name? What do you do? “I’m Christie, and I’m a partner and the business manager at a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” is a story, and it immediately sparks self-doubt. That isn’t an answer that describes an evidence-based reality, it is an answer that describes a story, and stories by definition require effort to be believed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Who I am, I am learning, is the collection of my experiences, which then drive my priorities in how I do what I do, which is business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In that podcast interview, I wasn’t told “there aren’t many business managers in the space.” I was told that there weren’t a lot of people with my background in the space. It’s the collection of my stories &#8211; of immigration, difficult childhoods, arguments in business school classrooms and accidentally viral WordPress websites, that perfectly positioned me to do what I’m doing right now.</p>\n<p>The main reason I wanted to write for HeroPress when Topher offered was to take these thoughts out of my story. The more I grow into this role, the more I’m learning that this is especially common with people like me.</p>\n<p>Research is being conducted more and more every day seeking to discover why we don’t become entrepreneurs who fearlessly pursue happiness and high-risk, high-reward situations (the common trope being that privilege is being told to strive to be anything one wants to be, while others are told to strive for an escape from instability).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most of it boils down to the idea that many minorities, women, immigrants, people from low-income households &#8211; take your pick &#8211; have convinced themselves of a story that does not, in fact, reflect the reality of their possibilities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s a shame, because there’s almost as much research that demonstrates that businesses with diverse leadership teams outperform homogeneous teams almost every single time.</p>\n<p>Let’s start talking about this, even if this isn’t something that directly relates to you. Because, if that is the case, chances are that this is a topic that relates to someone you know. Diversity of thought is an important part of our WordPress community narrative. If you are not the person who must assess replacing a story with an evidence-based reality, you may be someone who is positioned to engage in powerful actions to promote diversity of thought, like encouraging someone else to challenge the stories they tell themselves and the stories they tell others about themselves. “I’m Christie, and I lead all of the business development and marketing for a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” sounds a lot better.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=What%20I%20Do%20Does%20Not%20Define%20Who%20I%20Am&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F&title=What+I+Do+Does+Not+Define+Who+I+Am" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/092017-150x150.jpg&description=What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/" title="What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/">What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 12:00:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Christie Chirinos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.2 Patches Eight Security Vulnerabilities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74914";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-2-patches-eight-security-vulnerabilities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:840:"<p>WordPress 4.8.2 <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/">is available for download</a> and users are encouraged to update as soon as possible.

Version 3.2 is on track to make the process of updating stores a smoother experience with a long-awaited new feature that displays version compatibility checks to users prior to updating their extensions.</p>\n<p>Many WooCommerce store owners experienced considerable difficulties in updating to version 3.0 due to incompatibilities with extensions that were not fully compatible. The widespread problems with updating caused a direct hit to the plugin&#8217;s reputation, even though the main issue was with third-party extensions not being ready to go for 3.0. WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s new pre-update extension version checks will help users to be more informed about the status of extension compatibility before updating.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce plugin developers can now add two new headers to their extensions to specify a minimum required version and a &#8220;tested up to&#8221; version.<br />\n<code><br />\n/*<br />\n * Plugin Name: WooCommerce Barter Gateway<br />\n * Plugin URI: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-barter/<br />\n * Description: Take payments by bartering crops and livestock.<br />\n * Author: WooCommerce<br />\n * Author URI: https://woocommerce.com/<br />\n * Version: 3.0.7<br />\n * Text Domain: woocommerce-gateway-barter<br />\n * Domain Path: /languages<br />\n * WC requires at least: 3.0.0<br />\n * WC tested up to: 3.2.0<br />\n */</code></p>\n<p>Plugin authors are recommended to update these headers after each major and minor WooCommerce release. (Patch releases do not require headers to be updated.)</p>\n<p>The core WooCommerce plugin will check through the extension headers and display a warning to users when updates are available, detailing which plugins have or haven&#8217;t been tested with the latest major version.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pre-update-extension-version-checks.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WooCommerce developer Claudiu Lodromanean cited several important benefits for extension developers in a <a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing the new feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will have to field fewer complaints from users that the new WooCommerce version broke your plugin. They will have clear warnings about the dangers of upgrading when the plugin is incompatible. This should reduce your support load when new versions of WooCommerce are released.</li>\n<li>You will not have to rush updates to your plugin. If a user upgrades WooCommerce and your plugin breaks you are under a lot of pressure to release an update fast. If the user waits until a compatible version of the plugin is released before updating WooCommerce you do not have this problem.</li>\n<li>Users will trust your plugin more. By adding the header you are letting the user know that the plugin has been tested, works with their version of WooCommerce, and is actively maintained to be compatible with WooCommerce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The pre-update version checks for extensions is an exciting improvement for store owners and the greater WooCommerce developer community. Updates will be much easier when users can see at a glance which of their extensions are ready to go. Developers are also <a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/#comment-3635" target="_blank">interested in seeing this feature applied for themes</a> and the WooCommerce team confirmed they will look into the possibility.</p>\n<p><a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/important-update-woocommerce-3-2-will-now-be-released-october-11th/" target="_blank">WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s release date</a> has been pushed back one week to October 11 to give store owners and extension developers enough time to test.

As Vue is once again among the leading contenders, I reached out to Vue.js creator Evan You to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress adopting the framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, I had a conversation with the WordPress team mostly answering questions they had about Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;The discussion happened before Matt&#8217;s announcement of moving away from React. It was mostly intended for filling the team in with the state of Vue and there was no particular conclusion made from it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I got the feeling that the team had already decided to go with React and simply wanted to explore other options before they make the final call. I was a bit surprised by Matt&#8217;s post, but also understand the concerns behind that decision. I think React is a technically sound choice, and the whole patent issue is unfortunate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vue is back in the mix alongside Preact.js and other libraries WordPress core contributors are considering adopting. You has been active in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/31/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-30th/#comment-32642" target="_blank">comments</a> on the WordPress core development blog during the previous discussion, as well as more recently in the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733#issuecomment-330124938" target="_blank">discussion</a> in Gutenberg&#8217;s GitHub repo, clarifying misconceptions about the financial stability of the project.</p>\n<p>You has been careful to disclose his bias when participating in conversations about which framework WordPress should adopt. During my interview with him, he offered the community three reasons why he sees Vue as a good fit for the project:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now that WP has decided to pick a different framework, as the creator of Vue, I surely hope that the WordPress team can adopt Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Below is why I believe Vue would be a good fit for the choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;As an independent open source project (not born from within a major corporate), Vue provides a good alignment in terms of OSS values with the WordPress project. It&#8217;s fully MIT licensed, and its development is sustained by open financial contribution channels (via Patreon and OpenCollective). This means WordPress can easily ensure Vue&#8217;s sustainability by becoming a major sponsor.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Vue is one of the most approachable frameworks out there, with an established and active community, and ever-growing amount of learning resources. Adopting Vue would provide a low entry barrier and smooth learning curve for devs just getting into WordPress development. This also aligns with what made WordPress successful.</li>\n<li>&#8220;As an incrementally adoptable framework, Vue&#8217;s flexibility means it can be adapted in different use cases ranging from embedded widgets, plugin development to full single-page applications. It can be used without any compilation step in simple use cases, while being mature and powerful enough for more complex use cases such as Calypso and Gutenberg. It offers the complete stack from vdom + ability to use raw render functions, server-side rendering, routing, state management, build tooling, browser devtool extensions, to editor tooling support.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evan You and six others from the Vue.js core team will be participating in an <a href="https://hashnode.com/ama/with-vuejs-team-cj7itlrki03ae62wuv2r2005s" target="_blank">AMA on Hashnode at 12PM on September 20</a>, inviting general questions about the project, how to use it and contribute, and general programming advice. The questions are already rolling in and their answers should provide more information about the future of Vue and its place in the wider JavaScript ecosystem.</p>\n<p>WP Tavern has also reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit" target="_blank">Jason Miller</a>, creator of Preact.js to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress selecting Preact and what it would mean for both projects. The React-alternative is another strong contender among JS libraries WordPress is looking at for use in core.</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team has been working to ensure that WordPress developers will be able to create &#8220;Gutenblocks&#8221; using any JS library they prefer with different explorations of <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" target="_blank">framework-agnostic block rendering</a>. Ultimately, this would make creating plugins and themes less dependent on the library that is chosen for use in core. Other community members involved in the discussion, however, are keen to emphasize that the framework selected will have an impact on the greater WordPress product ecosystem, far beyond its use in Gutenberg, and are not eager to down play it as a simple technical decision. We&#8217;ll have a more detailed look on that in a separate post.</p>\n<p>In addition to the discussions on independent blogs, the Gutenberg GitHub issues queue and the #core-js channel on WordPress Slack are both hosting active conversations on the upcoming decision. This week&#8217;s core JavaScript chat has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/09/18/javascript-chat-canceled-for-september-19/" target="_blank">cancelled</a> due to many of those involved traveling or unable to attend. The agenda for the next meeting is to discuss the role a JavaScript framework will play in current and future core focuses (including but not limited to the Gutenberg editor).

HeroPress started out to be a voice for people on the fringe of WordPress, and being outside the ability to go to WordCamp practically defines the fringe.</p>\n<p>I never could figure out the logistics of how to make it work. How is money handled? International law? So the idea languished.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the world, <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/getting-a-life/">Ines van Essen</a> had the same idea. She&#8217;s far more clever than I though, and she&#8217;s making it happen. She&#8217;s starting a new organization called DonateWC, specifically to help people get to WordCamp.  Not just local WordCamps, but the large ones like WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US. Trips that can cost multiple months, or even a years salary.</p>\n<p>I am so so so excited that this is happening, Ines is my hero.</p>\n<h2>How You Can Help</h2>\n<p>To get things really rolling Ines needs some funds.  I mentioned logistics earlier; if this isn&#8217;t handled properly a tax agent somewhere is going to come investigating. A non-profit org needs to be created, a logo needs to be created, a site needs to be built, a board needs to be formed, etc. Getting started costs money.</p>\n<p>So <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/startup-cost-for-donatewc">there&#8217;s a GoFundMe page for DonateWC</a>. All things considered she&#8217;s not looking for very much money right now, we can DO THIS.</p>\n<p>If we can make this thing work it&#8217;s going to really change lives. Please help out if you can, and keep an eye on the project. The first person to get sent to WordCamp is going to make history.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=DonateWC%3A%20Getting%20People%20to%20WordCamp&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F&title=DonateWC%3A+Getting+People+to+WordCamp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23950564_1505660479.8301-150x150.png&description=DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/" title="DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/">DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 20:42:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"WPTavern: Vue Project Launches Community Campaign on OpenCollective";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74756";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"https://wptavern.com/vue-project-launches-community-campaign-on-opencollective";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4392:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-15-at-2.13.34-PM-e1505502876371.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With the recent news that <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library" target="_blank">WordPress is abandoning React</a> due to its BSD + Patents license, core contributors are now revisiting the discussion of the merits of other frameworks. Gutenberg development is currently on hold until a new library is chosen to replace React, and selection is likely to be imminent to prevent further delay.</p>\n<p><a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> is once again a strong contender with a recent surge in enthusiastic support in <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733" target="_blank">discussions on GitHub</a>, Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624213760974165/" target="_blank">social</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624383604290514/" target="_blank">media</a> posts. One of the chief concerns WordPress core contributors had regarding Vue in previous discussions was the longevity of the project and its dependence on creator <a href="https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion" target="_blank">Evan You</a>, who has historically done most of the development.</p>\n<p>The Vue project has recently been taking steps to mitigate this drawback. Earlier this week You announced that <a href="https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-is-now-on-opencollective-1ef89ca1334b" target="_blank">Vue is now accepting financial support on OpenCollective</a>, a platform for funding open source projects in a transparent way. You already has a successful <a href="https://www.patreon.com/evanyou" target="_blank">Patreon campaign</a> where contributors are paying $8,815 per month to support his work on Vue, but the new <a href="https://opencollective.com/vuejs" target="_blank">OpenCollective account</a> will support the work of core contributors and community events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I started the Patreon campaign, the primary goal was providing myself with enough income so that I can work on Vue full-time,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Today, as the Vue community grows, there are more and more contributions from the community, and OpenCollective’s transparent expense model could help us scale the financial contributions beyond a single developer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just four days after launching, Vue already has an estimated annual budget of $9,895 on its OpenCollective account. You is still independently accepting contributions on Patreon to fund his full-time work on the project.</p>\n<p><a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank">Preact</a>, the other leading contender WordPress core contributors are considering, has had an <a href="https://opencollective.com/preact" target="_blank">account on OpenCollective</a> since late 2016. Backers and sponsors have contributed to a $16,091 estimated annual budget for the project.</p>\n<p>Both Vue and Preact have growing networks of financial supporters and are not heavily influenced by a single corporation&#8217;s interests. WordPress core contributors continue to discuss the merits and drawbacks of the two frameworks on various places around the web, but the discussion is somewhat scattered and it&#8217;s difficult for participants to know where their feedback will receive consideration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main options are actually all pretty good, and we&#8217;d probably be fine going with any of them, which is makes it a tough decision — objectively and technically there isn&#8217;t one clear without-a-doubt winner,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg said today in WordPress&#8217; #core-js Slack channel.</p>\n<p>An updated post detailing the frameworks and technical considerations that contributors are now examining has yet to be published to the make/wordpress.org development blog. Having communication throughout the process of selecting the framework, instead of announcing it after the decision, would go a long way towards keeping the community informed and involved. We&#8217;ll be following the public discussion as it develops.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 19:54:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"WPTavern: WordPress Abandons React due to Patents Clause, Gutenberg to be Rewritten with a Different Library";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74834";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:118:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7411:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wrinkled-paper.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/6XVYR9HYNT">	Lalesh Aldarwish</a>\n<p>This evening Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/" target="_blank">announced</a> on his blog that WordPress has decided to move away from React due to its BSD + Patents clause licensing. Gutenberg engineers will be rewriting the new editor to use another JavaScript framework and Automattic plans to rewrite Calypso as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#8217;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#8217;t be published, and instead I&#8217;m here to say that the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg clarified that Automattic has been happy with React and that the company&#8217;s general counsel <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367" target="_blank">didn&#8217;t think they would ever run into the patent issue</a>. He also commended Facebook on being &#8220;one of the better open source contributors out there&#8221; and for making their intentions clear. Ultimately, Mullenweg decided that he wasn&#8217;t comfortable with the larger WordPress community inheriting the patents clause:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the long-term consistency with core is worth more than a short-term hit to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses, many open source project leaders and developers <a href="https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies" target="_blank">petitioned Facebook to consider re-licensing React</a>, as many React-based projects are now having to be rewritten. <a href="https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license" target="_blank">Facebook decided it wasn&#8217;t budging on the patents clause</a> and opted to continue protecting its own interests, fully recognizing that it may lose some React community members.</p>\n<p>In the past Mullenweg has been outspoken about how Automattic was betting on React. Many in the community considered WordPress adopting React to be a foregone conclusion, given that both Calypso and Jetpack&#8217;s new admin interface were built on it, as well as WordPress&#8217; new Gutenberg editor. In making the costly decision to rewrite Gutenberg and Automattic&#8217;s products in another library, Mullenweg has demonstrated he is willing to lead the WordPress project in a direction where the community can feel confident about continuing to use and extend the software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#8217;re always listening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg could certainly use the extra time and may gain a new crop of contributors, given that the learning curve for the new library isn&#8217;t likely to be as steep as learning React.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, WordPress core contributors had <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-debate-heats-up-contributors-narrow-discussion-to-react-vs-vue" target="_blank">narrowed their considerations for a new JavaScript framework to React and Vue</a>. It appears that <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> is still a strong contender. After a commenter on Mullenweg&#8217;s post suggested switching to Vue, he replied that it has been frequently suggested and that the team has met with Evan You, Vue&#8217;s lead developer.</p>\n<p>When I <a href="https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion" target="_blank">interviewed Evan You in June</a>, he said he didn&#8217;t have enough perspective on WordPress core to make an unbiased recommendation but offered feedback on some technical issues being discussed at the time. He also clarified some common misconceptions about Vue, which WordPress&#8217; React proponents had been using as leverage in their arguments against adopting it.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg also confirmed in the comments of his post that <a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank">Preact</a> is another library under consideration. Preact.js is a lightweight 3kB alternative to React that uses the same API but is MIT-licensed. Some are already speculating about Preact being the front-runner for the replacement, as Gutenberg already has a branch devoted to trying it.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a Preact “try” Gutenberg branch. But there is no Vue.js “try” Gutenberg branch. <a href="https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b">https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" /> (@carlhancock) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/908510738066657281">September 15, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, Mullenweg&#8217;s comment that the decision &#8220;will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year,&#8221; seems to only be feasible if the team rewrites the project using Preact.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For Gutenberg, not Calypso.

Many are thankful and relieved that Mullenweg made the tough decision to change course and select another library after investing so heavily in React.</p>\n<p>The discussion regarding the new framework continues behind closed doors and is not open to the public, although a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2732" target="_blank">pull request for using Preact in Gutenberg</a> is open on the project&#8217;s GitHub repo and some community discussion regarding the library selection is happening there.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 05:39:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: On React and WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47558";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3758:"<p>Big companies like to bury unpleasant news on Fridays: A few weeks ago, <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/">Facebook announced</a> they have decided to dig in on their patent clause addition to the React license, even after Apache had said <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303">it’s no longer allowed for Apache.org projects</a>. In their words, removing the patent clause would "increase the amount of time and money we have to spend fighting meritless lawsuits."</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m not judging Facebook or saying they&#x27;re wrong, it&#x27;s not my place. They have decided it&#x27;s right for them — it&#x27;s their work and they can decide to license it however they wish. I appreciate that they&#x27;ve made their intentions going forward clear.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Automattic used React as the basis for the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">ground-up rewrite of WordPress.com we called Calypso</a>, I believe it&#x27;s one of the larger React-based open source projects. As our general counsel wrote, <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367">we made the decision that we&#x27;d never run into the patent issue</a>. That is still true today as it was then, and overall, we’ve been really happy with React. More recently, the WordPress community started to use React for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/17/dev-chat-summary-february-15th-4-7-3-week-3/">Gutenberg</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">the largest core project we&#x27;ve taken on in many years</a>. People&#x27;s experience with React and the size of the React community &#8212;  including Calypso &#8212; was a factor in trying out React for Gutenberg, and that made React the new de facto standard for WordPress and the tens of thousands of plugins written for WordPress.</p>\n<p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#x27;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same.

Both camps <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-meetup-groups-in-belfast-and-dublin-are-planning-wordcamps-for-2016-and-2017" target="_blank">began the early stages of planning last year</a> and the two communities have shared some of the same organizers across their teams to help get these new camps off the ground in Ireland.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will be held at <a href="http://business.dcu.ie/" target="_blank">DCU Business School</a> and ticket sales will be capped at 250. In truly affordable WordCamp tradition, tickets are only €35 and include access to two tracks of speakers on both camp days, catered lunch, and an after party on Saturday night in Dublin City Centre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given it’s our first WordCamp Dublin it’s difficult to select a venue when we’ve no idea about how many people would like to attend,&#8221; co-organizer Colm Troy said. &#8220;But demand so far has been great so if you want a ticket I’d recommend getting one sooner rather than later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the camp&#8217;s five organizers are also part of the Dublin WordPress meetup, which is fairly active with 25-30 people attending regularly. They meet the first Thursday of every month and host a local speaker to teach attendees something new. WordPress developers generally gravitate towards the more technical talks, while WordPress users are more interested in talks about improving and promoting their websites.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will feature one track with advanced WordPress, coding, and development topics and a second track that covers aspects of running a business, growing website traffic, podcasting, and other related topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;​The Dublin WordPress community, based on what I’ve seen and experienced elsewhere (Buenos Aires, Paris, Vienna, UK, Italy), is pretty unusual,&#8221; co-organizer Rodolfo Melogli said. In addition to co-organizing the local WordPress meetup, Melogli also organizes the Dublin E-commerce and WooCommerce Meetups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have complete beginners, who after years of using other CMSs have finally decided to start using WordPress,&#8221; Melogli said. &#8220;We have passionate bloggers, who have been exploiting the SEO and content management features of WordPress since the very beginning. Then, we&#8217;ve got successful themers, popular plugin developers and experienced WordPress freelancers. Making sure everyone is catered for at each WordPress meetup and at the upcoming WordCamp is our biggest challenge and main priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The beautiful thing about the WordPress community, and especially in Dublin, is that you can have a successful theme seller sitting beside a complete beginner. And they both have things to share.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers have just announced the <a href="https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/speakers-2017/" target="_blank">full lineup of speakers</a> for the WordCamp and co-organizer Colm Troy said the team was &#8220;blown away by the quality and quantity of excellent speaking applications&#8221; they received.</p>\n<p>The camp&#8217;s designers have created a new &#8220;blocky&#8221; style wapuu for the occasion to accompany the event&#8217;s modular design theme. They were aiming for a Lego-like wapuu while incorporating the cosmopolitan landmark &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_of_Dublin" target="_blank">Spire of Dublin</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-dublin-2017.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;​We have a couple of ideas floating around that will definitely add a unique Irish aspect to WordCamp Dublin but it’s too early to let the cat out of the bag on those yet,&#8221; Troy said. &#8220;In terms of what people can expect, Dublin and Ireland in general has a well earned reputation as one of the most welcoming places in the world. In many ways, our welcoming spirit is closely aligned with the ethos of the WordPress community and I think it’s going to be a really special weekend for attendees regardless of whether they’re new to WordPress or WordCamp veterans.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:15:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: GitHub Partners with Facebook to Release Atom-IDE";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74752";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wptavern.com/github-partners-with-facebook-to-release-atom-ide";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3269:"<p>GitHub <a href="http://blog.atom.io/2017/09/12/announcing-atom-ide.html" target="_blank">announced</a> the launch of Atom-IDE this week, a new set of packages that extend its open source JavaScript-powered code editor to include IDE-like functionality.

Users who want to get started with Atom-IDE will need to install the Atom IDE UI package as well as an IDE language support package (i.e. <a href="https://atom.io/packages/ide-php" target="_blank">ide-php</a>).</p>\n<p>Using Atom-IDE currently requires Atom Beta 1.21+. In the future the team plans to add support for more languages, which will most likely happen through outside package contributions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the help of our community, we plan to expand the number of languages that Atom-IDE can support and make it possible for you to run and edit applications, making Atom-IDE a true IDE,&#8221; Damien Guard said. &#8220;We hope to see future language support for the great languages out there including Rust, Go, Python, etc.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 02:12:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Display Widgets Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Malicious Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74768";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6033:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-widgets/" target="_blank">Display Widgets</a>, a plugin with more than 200,000 active installs, has been removed from WordPress.org due to its authors inserting malicious code. SEO consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-law-9444b637/" target="_blank">David Law</a> was the first to bring this issue to the attention of the plugin team after discovering that Display Widgets was inserting content into sites from external servers and also collecting visitor data without permission.

According to their independent investigation, the plugin included a backdoor that allowed the plugin author to publish spam content to the sites where Display Widgets is installed. It also prevented logged-in users from being able to see the content.</p>\n<p><a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2017/09/malicious-code-display-widgets/" target="_blank">Pagely banned the Display Widgets plugin</a> from its hosting platform this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For our customer’s safety, we have banned the plugin from our customer sites&#8230;The plugin will remained banned on our network until a time that we see someone has taken responsibility for the plugin and the future of patching its code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets had recently changed hands, as it was acquired from the team that created Formidable Forms.

They do not receive a notice in the WordPress admin about the plugin having been removed from the directory. Since Display Widgets was a fairly popular plugin, there are likely many sites that still have it active and those website owners are probably unaware of the spam content they are publishing.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the plugin team issued a notice that <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-2-7-is-safe/" target="_blank">Display Widgets 2.7 is a clean version</a> that restores the plugin to version 2.0.5 before the malicious code was added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will be leaving this version deploying updates, however at this time we will NOT be allowing for its adoption. The second owner has effectively destroyed any trust a person might have in the plugin.</p>\n<p>Note: You CANNOT visit the page or download it as a new plugin for a reason. This plugin is done. It’s not supported, it’s not worked on, nothing. So if you have it, upgrade. Otherwise, find something else to use.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets is now likely to end up in the graveyard of abandoned plugins, but there are many other options for adding conditional widget display to WordPress sites. Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/widget-visibility/" target="_blank">widget visibility module</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-options/" target="_blank">Widget Options</a> by Phpbits Creative Studio, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-sidebars/" target="_blank">Custom Sidebars</a> by WPMU Dev, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-aware-sidebars/" target="_blank">Content Aware Sidebars</a> are a few popular alternatives on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The plugin team does not currently disclose why certain plugins have been closed or removed from WordPress.org, but they are working on providing better communication for users. One meta trac <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2627" target="_blank">ticket</a> requests that closed plugins have a public page instead of disappearing completely. In another related <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2860" target="_blank">ticket</a>, plugin team member Mika Epstein has proposed that when plugins are closed or disabled, there should be a dropdown for WordPress.org admins to select a reason why. She suggested the following as available options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Issue</li>\n<li>Author Request</li>\n<li>Guideline Violation</li>\n<li>Licensing/Trademark violations</li>\n<li>Merged into Core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue with Display Widgets was fairly public as users posted about their investigations on the WordPress.org support forums and various companies issued warnings about it. However, many plugins are disabled without the public knowing why. Even a short explanation like the proposed examples above would be a major improvement over leaving WordPress.org plugin users in the dark. It would assist site owners in knowing whether they need to prioritize looking for an alternative or simply wait until the situation is resolved.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:08:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"HeroPress: Making My Own Normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2098";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:114:"https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=making-my-own-normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8262:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine." /><p>As long as I can remember being normal was my only goal in life. If only I could be normal, then everything would be alright. There was not a lot wrong in my life when I was a kid, growing up in a small dutch town. I had a normal family with 2 parents (a mum and a dad) and a younger sister. My life was pretty normal. The problem was: It didn’t feel normal; I didn’t feel normal. You see, everybody was going through life living by certain rules and I lived my life not knowing those rules. Nobody told me, but apparently they told everybody else.</p>\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\n<p>When I was 35 I got diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. I cannot tell you how relieved I was after receiving such a clear diagnoses. All those years working so hard to fit in there was an explanation why I didn’t. Why I couldn’t. That was a big deal. It was not that I wouldn&#8217;t that I didn’t try hard enough or was to lazy. There was something different about me why I couldn’t. Not understanding the rules of life? Being clumsy and inappropriate in social situation? Being obsessed about some things and totally not interested in others? It was all part of the package.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting the right diagnosis changed everything and at the same time it didn’t change anything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problems I had to face were still the same. The way to handle them just got more clear. And there was help. I started reading books, I started therapy and I started working with a coach to find a way to integrate this new knowledge into my life. I started looking at what I needed (what??) and finding ways to take care of myself. I really thought this was it. I found the keys, I could learn the rules and finally be a normal person.</p>\n<p>And then I got fired.</p>\n<p>Having a job was a big part of being normal in my head. Getting fired ruined my chances of ever getting there. I was working as an assistant manager in the local library. I liked my job, and the people I worked with and they liked me. I loved going to work. But the library had to cut their expenses and I was one of the people that got fired. It happens but I was completely shocked.</p>\n<p>My experiences with jobs were not good (to put it mildly). There wasn’t one I kept longer than 2 years. You can do the math; I had a lot of jobs since I started working. Some were fun most were not. I got fired many of times. Getting fired was not a new thing. Liking a job and not wanting to get fired and getting fired anyway was what upset me the most. So I decided to start my own company.</p>\n<h3>Taking Control</h3>\n<p>Looking back it was a ridiculous plan but strangely enough, it worked out. I started helping people with their Social Media and building website with WordPress.</p>\n<p>I learned WordPress for fun. I wasn’t interested in computers or tech stuff. I was just a little obsessed with making a website for the domain name my boyfriend gave me for my birthday a few years earlier. I had nothing to say but was totally fascinated by what you can do with a website. It was like magic to me. Some written code turned into a beautiful page, or an ugly one. I wanted to know all about that. Building things with HTML and CSS was easy. Code is logic (and poetry of course;-)). It does what you tell it to do. If it doesn’t you did something wrong. Never a discussion about it.</p>\n<p>I shied away from people. It was too confusing for me now that I found something that was so easy and logical.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I could make money without seeing other people, it felt like heaven.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For a while. This is really what makes this whole thing so disturbing. I want to be alone, but also want to be around other people. I appear to be good with people. A lot of people like me (who knew?!). They have no idea how confusing it is not knowing what the underlying rule set is others are acting by. It’s like interacting with someone from a totally different culture speaking a different language but both of you don’t know that. I got really good at guessing things through the years, but that didn’t make it any less uncomfortable. I also got really scared. Because not all people are understanding and friendly when you try to explain.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>In 2011 I went to my first WordPress meetup. I was shocked! These people did what I did and actually knew what they were doing and talked about it. I was blown away with all this new knowledge and information. I needed to know more and learn more. So I went back into my WordPress cave and studied, practiced and learned more.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe happened for the first time in 2013 in The Netherlands. I signed up as a volunteer. I visited WordCamp NL the year before. As a visitor I didn’t know how to meet new people. That was a lonely experience. I loved the knowledge that was shared but I knew I had to find a way to talk to those people. I figured being a volunteer would give me something to do and a reason to talk to people. And it did.</p>\n<p>I met new people, I was shy, I was scared, I acted totally inappropriate and I was exhausted for a week after the event but I did it. The people were nice. Some seem to like me and I had fun. This was a totally new experience. If only this could normal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I attended more WordCamps, always as a volunteer, that was my safe place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My confidence grew. The number of people I knew grew. The amount of fun I had grew. And never ever did I feel not normal. As my confidence grew I got more visible and things got even better. It’s an upward spiral. This year I held my first talk, at WordCamp London. I was MC at WordCamp EU in Paris en I am on the organising team for WordCamp EU 2018 (BIG things!).</p>\n<p>Did these experiences end my quest to becoming “normal”?</p>\n<p>When I turned 40 I decided to quit the quest. I was done trying to be normal. Not because I became normal but I broadened my worldview. There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine. It took me a while ( and a lot of redirections) to find the one that fits me best.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Making%20My%20Own%20Normal&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F&title=Making+My+Own+Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-150x150.jpg&description=Making My Own Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/" title="Making My Own Normal"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/">Making My Own Normal</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:00:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Wendie Huis in ‘t Veld";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: WordPress.org Adds New Support Rep Role for Plugin Pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74726";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-adds-new-support-rep-role-for-plugin-pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1424:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/collaboration.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress.org introduced a new feature for plugin pages this week that highlights official support representatives. Plugin authors can now find the UI for adding support reps under the Advanced View on the plugin page.

It includes the ability to mark forum topics as resolved or sticky. Previously, only plugin authors were able to do this, which made it difficult for support teams to fully manage forum topics. Support reps will now have their interactions highlighted in the forum:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/support-rep-reply.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Adding these official indicators to support reps&#8217; replies puts them in context within the thread and lends more authority to their answers.

With billions of dollars flowing through the WordPress economy, tensions are high, as many people support themselves and their families with the revenue earned from products and services that have been built on the existing editor.</p>\n<p>First impressions range from outright rejection of the new editor to those who embrace it and are hopeful for what it will bring to WordPress. For the past several years, most major new features added to WordPress have come through the feature plugin/feature project process where release leads and other contributors decide whether a proposed feature is ready for merge. The Gutenberg project is taking a somewhat different path to core in that Matt Mullenweg has already confirmed that <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-addresses-concerns-about-gutenberg-confirms-new-editor-to-ship-with-wordpress-5-0" target="_blank">Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0</a>, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready. This approach is part of Mullenweg&#8217;s new strategy for core development that makes releases more project-based instead of time-based.</p>\n<p>One of the most common concerns that developers and agency owners have about the plan to include Gutenberg in 5.0 is that they may need to hold back some of their sites from updating. The most vocal opponents have called for a way to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of Gutenberg so that it isn&#8217;t forced on their users.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://valiantchickendigital.com/blog/wordpress-new-coke-moment/" target="_blank">WordPress is about to have its New Coke moment</a>,&#8221; Nate Hoffelder shared his first impressions of the new edidtor after taking it for a test run. He said he appreciates the changes it promises but was unable to figure out how to create the blocks in the demo and worries about the &#8220;average non-techie&#8221; trying to use the interface.</p>\n<p>Hoffelder referenced Coca-Cola&#8217;s attempt to introduce New Coke in April 1985, which quickly ended in consumers calling for a return of the original flavor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My gut feeling is that if users share my frustrations with Gutenberg, they will demand the return of the old interface,&#8221; Hoffelder said. &#8220;But the official release is months and months away, so it is entirely possible that a UX (user experience) expert will force the Gutenberg developers to make Gutenberg easier to use before it is inflicted upon an unsuspecting public.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Users Will be Able to Restore the Old Editor with a Plugin after Gutenberg Lands in Core</h3>\n<p>WordPress will move forward with the Gutenberg editor as the default experience in the 5.0 release, but Matt Mullenweg confirmed in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587616" target="_blank">comment</a> on his blog that a plugin will be available for users who want to restore the old editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg uses TinyMCE, so a better way to think of it is that Gutenberg is a new version of our approach to TinyMCE,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It will be the default experience of WP, for people that want to use something more like what’s currently there we’ll have a plugin they can use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This should bring some relief to developers who will not yet have updated their extensions to work with Gutenberg, as well as agency owners who are not ready to give their clients access to the new editor.</p>\n<p>In his post, titled <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason" target="_blank">We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason</a>, Mullenweg shared his vision for how the new editor will will re-imagine TinyMCE and the advantages it will bring for plugin editors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Plugin developers will be able to completely integrate into every part of WordPress, including posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars without having to hack TinyMCE or squeeze their entire feature behind a toolbar button. Today, every plugin that extends WordPress does it in a different way; Gutenberg’s blocks provide a single, easy-to-learn entry point for an incredible variety of extensions. Some folks have already begun to port their plugins over, and are finding that they’re easier to build and have a much improved UI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For developers who are worried about the compatibility of their metaboxes, Mullenweg said <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587620" target="_blank">a plugin will be available for providing the legacy edit page for metaboxes</a>. One commenter, whose sites are heavily dependent on Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), asked if there is going to be a version of WordPress that will get long-term support for sites that can&#8217;t be upgraded to 5.0 without breaking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There won’t be a version of WP like that, but there will definitely be a plugin that gives you the legacy / old edit page. Make sure to let ACF know that Gutenberg compatibility is a top priority,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Scott Kingsley Clark, lead developer of the Pods plugin, said this support for legacy PHP meta boxes is welcome news for the project but that Pods is also looking to get on board with Gutenberg once the project&#8217;s engineers have a solution for metaboxes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m very excited to start using the new meta boxes from Gutenberg once the API supports it and gives us more to utilize,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;As soon as that’s available, count us in for immediate adoption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite assurances that a plugin will be available to restore the old interface, some are still concerned about how Gutenberg will impact the WordPress ecosystem. The average WordPress user has never heard of Gutenberg and its inclusion in 5.0 will be a major change.</p>\n<p>In a recent article on WPShout Fred Meyer contends that <a href="https://wpshout.com/stop-presses-gutenberg-wordpress-needs-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough/" target="_blank">Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough</a> towards giving users what they really want, which he identifies as front-end editing and the ability to create layouts within post content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;It won’t make WordPress’ core content editor competitive with hosted builder solutions, or even with WordPress’ own themes and plugins (including badly built, bad-for-the-community solutions like Visual Composer.)&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meyer believes Gutenberg has the opportunity to defragment WordPress&#8217; ecosystem of page building tools, but only if it moves towards providing &#8220;a feature-rich, developer-friendly, front-end page builder and content editor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In responding to feedback from the community, Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister has said that the project is currently focusing on editing before tackling the page building experience. The team has also been <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587693" target="_blank">working with the authors of page builder plugins</a> ahead of the next focus on customization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is still a little early to say what will happen to plugins and builders,&#8221; Lister <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587692" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;Initially, Gutenberg is focusing on the editor. The next stage is for the Customization focus (the building of pages). One thing that will need to happen is a lot of testing of existing plugins with Gutenberg. That’s how we can ensure things do work and limit issues. Ultimately, more and more plugins won’t be needed – or at least not so many together to achieve simple things. This benefits users and creates a better, more unified experience for all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If users&#8217; first impression of Gutenberg is that it is unable to deliver on all of the lofty promises of the project, they may return to the old interface en masse. WordPress will then have a battle to convince users to give it a another chance as the experience improves to include customization.</p>\n<p>Multi-column layouts, which are the gateway to page building, are <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-adding-drag-and-drop-and-multi-column-support-for-blocks" target="_blank">not currently within the scope of the first official version coming to core</a>. Gutenberg&#8217;s one-dimensional, vertically stacking approach to designing pages isn&#8217;t very inspiring. This may frustrate average users whose expectations have not been tempered with the understanding that a future version will include an expanded page building experience. A plugin that allows users to opt out until it is an improvement over their current tools is going to be crucial for keeping the community happy.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 04:22:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"WPTavern: “The Final Word” Plugin Extends O2 to Pin a Highlighted Comment to the Top of a Thread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74707";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"https://wptavern.com/the-final-word-plugin-extends-o2-to-pin-a-highlighted-comment-to-the-top-of-a-thread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3311:"<p>&#8220;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-final-word/" target="_blank">The Final Word</a>&#8221; is a new plugin that extends O2 to highlight a comment at the top of a thread. <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/o2" target="_blank">O2</a> is the plugin successor to <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/p2/" target="_blank">P2</a>, Automattic&#8217;s group blogging theme that introduced quick posting from the front page with real-time comment updates.

Hugh Lashbrooke <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/08/24/o2-plugin-request-the-final-word/" target="_blank">created The Final Word for use on the WordPress Community Team blog</a> so that long discussion threads could be summed up in a single comment. He likened the new feature as something similar to the &#8220;accepted answer&#8221; function on Stack Exchange or other support forums where the best answer floats to the top. Discussions in the Community P2 often involve decision making, and the plugin is useful for highlighting the team&#8217;s conclusion on a matter.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/top-comment.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Final Word gives users who are able to edit the post the ability to mark a specific comment as the &#8220;top comment.&#8221; Other features include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The top comment is displayed at the top of the comment list with a ‘view in context’ anchor link</li>\n<li>The top comment is also highlighted in context in the thread</li>\n<li>Only one comment can be selected as the top comment</li>\n<li>The top comment flag can be removed</li>\n<li>Includes basic styling for top comments</li>\n<li>‘Top comment’ label can be translated and/or filtered</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin currently will not work without 02 enabled because of its specific way of handling comments, but Lashbrooke said it may be updated in the future to work without O2. (While O2 is not theme-dependent, the plugin is also not guaranteed to work with every theme and is recommended to be used in combination with the <a href="https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe" target="_blank">p2-breathe theme</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Final Word is now active on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/community" target="_blank">WordPress Community team&#8217;s blog</a> and is available for other teams to activate as well. With the number of O2 blogs that many contributors are subscribed to, there is a massive amount of information and discussion to keep up with. This plugin gives thread authors and team leaders the ability to summarize conversations and keep them more manageable for readers and participants.

A username is part of your online identity. It is meant to identify, not verify, who you are saying you are. Verification is the job of the password.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, people do not consider usernames to be secret, often sharing them openly. Additionally, many major online establishments — such as Google and Facebook — have done away with usernames in favor of email addresses, which are shared around constantly and freely. WordPress has also moved this way, allowing users to log in with an email address or username since version 4.5.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress Core Security Team Lead Aaron Campbell clarified this section of the handbook to confirm that the users endpoint is intended to be an open API endpoint that serves public data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It does in fact include usernames and user IDs (among other things) for users that have published posts in a post type that is set up to use the API, but all the data is considered public,&#8221; Campbell said.</p>\n<p>Campbell also said he is wary of entering personal data into the equifaxsecurity2017.com website, but not because it is using WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the fact that it runs on WordPress is a concern from a security standpoint, with the caveat that I don&#8217;t know what ELSE it&#8217;s using,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;&#8216;Equifax&#8217; is a trusted brand, but it&#8217;s not the official Equifax domain and the SSL certificate doesn&#8217;t verify ownership. So you know your data is encrypted, but not necessarily who it&#8217;s being sent to since you don&#8217;t know who owns the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Equifax simply didn&#8217;t build out the information site on its own domain. According to security investigator <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" target="_blank">Brian Krebs</a>, the company appears to have hired Edelman PR, a global PR firm, to handle its public response to the data breach, citing the username publicly displayed by WordPress&#8217; API.

In responding to the incident with a website that appears to have been hastily implemented for its own convenience and corporate interests, Equifax has missed an opportunity to reclaim any remaining consumer confidence from the public.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 20:04:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: SWFUpload Will Officially Be Removed From WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74660";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wptavern.com/swfupload-will-officially-be-removed-from-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2000:"<p>SWFUpload is an open-source library that was used by WordPress in 2011 and earlier that allowed users to upload files.

If you use one or more of the plugins mentioned above, please get in touch with the author and ask if it will function <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/09/07/removing-swfupload/">without SWFUpload in core</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 08:06:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: WordCamp Ann Arbor to Host Second WordCamp WarmUp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74654";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-ann-arbor-to-host-second-wordcamp-warmup";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2080:"<p><a href="https://2017.annarbor.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Ann Arbor, MI</a>, is set to take place October 13-14 and for the second year in a row, organizers will host a secondary event called <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-warmup-an-experimental-event-aimed-at-breaking-the-ice-for-new-wordcamp-attendees">WordCamp WarmUp</a>.

Meanwhile, discussions about Gutenberg&#8217;s timing, implications, UI, architecture, and other aspects of the project continue across the web, as the community grapples with what this new editor will mean for the future of WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/09/05/whats-new-in-gutenberg-september-5/" target="_blank">Version 1.1.0</a> was released this week with a new autocomplete-shortcut for adding new blocks without leaving the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Many testers have been frustrated with the amount of pointing and clicking required to create new blocks. Autocomplete for blocks is a new feature that partially answers this problem, but it relies on the user knowing that typing a slash <code>/</code> in a new default paragraph block will trigger autocomplete. It may also be added to other blocks in the future.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/autocomplete.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;We still need to get the point-click/tap interactions right since most people won’t discover, remember, nor use keyboard shortcuts,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Matías Ventura <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587704" target="_blank">said</a> in response to user feedback on the plugin.</p>\n<p>This release of the plugin adds the ability to remove images from the gallery block inline. It works smoothly and resizes the thumbnail previews to fit the available space after an image is removed.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gutenberg-gallery-delete-image.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 1.1.0 also includes small updates like the ability to set links to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2628" target="_blank">open in a new window</a>, accessibility improvements to the add-new-category form, caption styling for video blocks, adjustments to column width calculation in the gallery block, and many other tweaks and improvements. The <a href="http://gutenberg-devdoc.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Gutenberg docs</a> also received <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2638" target="_blank">an updated design</a> and improvements to the content.</p>\n<h3>A Preview of How Gutenberg Will Interact with Themes to Build Websites</h3>\n<p>Gutenberg engineers elaborated on how they expect the new editor will work with themes in a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/31/gutenberg-themes/" target="_blank">post</a> on the make.wordpress./core blog. Matías Ventura published two video examples to demonstrate where they see Gutenberg headed on its journey towards becoming a full-fledged website building tool. Ventura said this is the long-term goal after the project completes the post and page editing milestone.</p>\n<p>The first video shows how Gutenberg can be used for page building, starting with a blank slate and a theme that defines specific styles for blocks. The second one shows how a theme might include templates with blocks already in place that provide users with a guided page-building experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These examples clarify some of the benefits the team is aiming for with Gutenberg and how WordPress theme authors will be able to build more user-friendly experiences on top of the new editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are quickly put together, but I hope it shows how things can progress even with very straightforward theme integration,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;As soon as we expand the scope and include more blocks (site title, site header, menus, more widgets, etc), and describe a way to store page templates as a «list of blocks», Gutenberg would be fundamentally capable of building an entire website.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 07 Sep 2017 20:02:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 287 – WordPress Meetups, Events, and WordCamps with Andrea Middleton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=74614&preview=true&preview_id=74614";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-287-wordpress-meetups-events-and-wordcamps-with-andrea-middleton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1776:"<p>In this episode, <a href="https://jjj.blog/">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href="https://andreamiddleton.blog/">Andrea Middleton</a>, Dot org Wrangler at Automattic.

People would know all the neighbors, they would pay each other visits every week to talk about what’s been going on in the community and to have a beer or two. It all seemed great until the moment when I got a bit older and went to Junior High School. My hair, unlike all other boys’, was long and I enjoyed listening to rock / metal music, the genre that was considered weird, unknown, maybe even evil.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Suddenly this friendly community started treating me like an alien, someone they refused to treat as one of their own or spend time with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Almost every day I would get some beatings from school bullies, they would pull my hair, call me names, in short &#8211; my life became miserable. I had to find a way to survive, something to focus on.</p>\n<p>That’s when I started spending even more time with my computer, playing Diablo (I even set up a Diablo fan club which became quite popular in Poland) and other multiplayer games that connected me with new people. All these interesting personalities living there, somewhere far away, (and the unforgettable sound of a dial-up modem) made me believe there was something good out there waiting for me.</p>\n<p>Next, natural step was the analysis of how a game could be created. I spent months looking at the code and analyzing its components. There weren’t many tutorials back then, so sometimes it took a while to figure things out. But it all led to building my first website, which was full of tables and hundreds of colorful elements, everything was there! I was so proud of myself! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<p>When I went to High School, I already knew a thing or two about coding and I wasn’t afraid to use it! I moved to a big city, got my first job as a graphic designer and started renting my own apartment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was very young, full of energy and determination to change my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After a while I got another job and another, and suddenly I realized that coding became an essential part of my life. Instead of learning chemistry and biology, I spent my nights learning new ways of improving my skills and finally was offered a pretty sweet job in a huge company, where I led a team of front-end developers. Yes, I was about 19, but I felt so mature. It’s so funny now, when I recall that feeling of accomplishing “everything”, but hey, I knew CSS ‘hacks’ on IE 6, I knew it all!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course, I had heard of WordPress, but none of the ‘true’ coders would use it, so why would I want to dig into that?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, I’m glad someone helped me change my mind. In 2010 my colleague invited me to join him on WordCamp. In Poland WordPress was still considered a cute little tool for creating internet blogs, so I thought going there would be a waste of time, but it turned out to be a life-changing experience. The opportunity to meet people from different countries, hear them talk about the growing possibilities of WordPress made me realize I was in the right place. The fact that a few people I met there are still my friends today only stresses the importance of that event.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It simply dawned on me that it’s not really about the CMS or other technical elements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress turned out to be a tool that led me to meeting a fantastic community of interesting and friendly people. And this was one of the reasons I wanted to delve further into WordPress.</p>\n<p>Two years later I started cooperating with a company based in the United States. Their main tool to build sites on was WordPress, obviously. By the way, I’ve been with this company for over 5 years now and to be honest, I can’t imagine my life without those guys now, but I don’t want to keep you here too long, so let’s move on. I quit my safe, ‘nine to five’ job to the dismay of my parents and started working remotely. Everything was so new, so exciting, but at the same time physically and mentally exhausting. I was doing my master’s degree in e-business and I rarely slept through the night, mostly because my clients were from different time zones.</p>\n<p>To make things more exciting, I applied for a grant from the European Union and registered my own little company in Poland. But hey, I still felt unsated. It took me around a year to decide to move my company to the United States and go there to manage it. Actually, part of this time was spent on convincing my wife to quit the job she didn’t like anyway, but again, no subplots.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To say that moving to the States was easy would be a monstrous lie.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dealing with visas and all types of immigration documents is very time-consuming and caused us way too many sleepless nights, but eventually we got to California! I registered my company (again!), opened a bank account (you wouldn’t believe how difficult it was, so thank you, dear Russian lady for fighting with the system for over 2 hours!), and looked for a place to stay.</p>\n<p>Almost 3 years have passed, I’ve been given a chance to work with amazing people whom I truly admire, and I work for and with a few startups that, I admit, are close to my heart. One of the projects my wife and I are working on is a platform (based on WordPress, of course) that will help freelancers find good, well paid projects. Again, right time, right place, no doubt about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I know you&#8217;ve heard it a thousand times before. But it&#8217;s true &#8211; hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don&#8217;t love something, then don&#8217;t do it.“ (Ray Bradbury)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very often people ask me if it’s all worth it, if I’m a masochist and enjoy burning the midnight oil, but I don’t see it that way. If I have a goal, whether it’s one to create a new website, or learn how to prepare real pierogi (dumplings) for my wife, I’m ready to spend as much time as needed to accomplish it. Sure, if it’s not something I truly ‘feel’, I might not be able to devote 100 percent of my energy to make it happen, but I like to think it’s a matter of making the right choices.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying it’s all rainbows and butterflies right now, I’m not a guy who spends his days surfing or drinking cocktails. To be honest I don’t think I’ll ever be that guy. I’m still working very hard and I rarely take days off, but at least when I go to bed I have a feeling that I’ve done all I could to help others and improve my skills as a front-ender, project manager and most of all, a human being.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Crafting%20the%20Life%20You%20Want&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F&title=Crafting+the+Life+You+Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/090617-150x150.jpg&description=Crafting the Life You Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/" title="Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/">Crafting the Life You Want</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 12:00:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Damian Samolej";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: Jetpack 5.3 Adds PHP 7.1 Compatibility, Better Control for WordAds Placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74547";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-3-adds-php-7-1-compatibility-better-control-for-wordads-placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2636:"<p><a href="https://jetpack.com/2017/09/05/jetpack-5-3-php-7-1-compatibility/" target="_blank">Jetpack 5.3</a> was released with compatibility for PHP 7.1, a task the Jetpack team has been working on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6106" target="_blank">since January 2017</a> after they received multiple reports of <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6629" target="_blank">failures with PHP 7.1 when opcache was enabled</a>. This interfered with XML-RPC requests and some users reported issues managing their sites from WordPress.com and connecting to third-party apps. Downgrading to PHP 7.0 or disabling opcache in PHP 7.1 provided temporary workarounds for many users but this is no longer required as of Jetpack 5.3.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, <a href="https://wptavern.com/jetpack-4-5-expands-monetization-with-wordads-integration" target="_blank">Jetpack added integration with WordAds</a>, WordPress.com’s advertising program. Over the past few years the program has evolved to get better at distinguishing sites with higher quality traffic and allocating earnings accordingly. This correction, along with industry-wide declining ad rates, has given publishers more modest earnings expectations after the first few years of unpredictable payouts. Jetpack 5.3 offers customers on the Premium and Professional plans more control over how ads are displayed.</p>\n<p>This release adds the ability for publishers to display multiple ads and introduces more control options for where they can be placed. Since WordAds pays based on the number of impressions (combined with many other factors) and not the number of clicks, selecting the right combination of placement options is important for success.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordads-jetpack5-3.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other notable changes and improvements include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can preview their sites without leaving WordPress.com</li>\n<li>WordPress.com Toolbar updated to include link to comments</li>\n<li>Omnisearch feature was removed</li>\n<li>Improved performance in the admin by cutting back on unnecessary requests</li>\n<li>VideoPress shortcode includes option to stop video from looping during autoplay</li>\n<li>Fixed compatibility issues with plugins using TinyMCE</li>\n<li>Re-added a filter for Widget Visibility that was accidentally removed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a full list of all the changes included in Jetpack 5.3, check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/#developers" target="_blank">changelog</a> on WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 05:46:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids Attendees Share First Impressions of Gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74538";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-attendees-share-first-impressions-of-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2688:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-grand-rapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>While attending <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> I had the opportunity to interview developers and business owners about their first impressions of the new Gutenberg editor. Many attendees I spoke to had not yet heard of the project but were intrigued and decided to install the plugin on a test site. A few attendees were developers who have already contributed to Gutenberg and are experimenting with extending the editor.</p>\n<p>Those who have tested the beta have varied concerns, depending on how they use WordPress in their professions. Some are waiting to begin testing until the plugin provides a more consistent experience. One of the most common concerns for developers is how the editor will handle meta boxes. Freelancers and agency owners are waiting to see how the new editor will affect their businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How much am I going to have to change what my company does as a business to build websites with this new tool?&#8221; Topher DeRosia asked.</p>\n<p>Agency owner Sara Dunn said she is excited about what Gutenberg will bring to WordPress and undaunted by the prospect of getting clients acquainted to a new interface. She believes the project has a lot of potential to solve some of the most common client frustrations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited about it, because I have a lot of clients who say they can&#8217;t stand WordPress because when they look at the backend and update their pages and posts, it doesn&#8217;t look how it looks on the frontend,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I really think WordPress needs this move to compete in the future, and I&#8217;m excited about where it&#8217;s going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John James Jacoby, one of the developers who has contributed to Gutenberg and experimented with extending it, said he considers it to be a very ambitious project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is probably one of the most important projects that anyone has worked on with WordPress in a number of years, in my opinion,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;My take on it is that everyone has the responsibility to try to influence the direction that it&#8217;s going to take. If we care about the open web and the freedom of how people publish to it, then we should all try to join in and help with its ongoing development and make it as good as it can be if it&#8217;s going to end up as part of WordPress in the coming months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the interviews below to see how attendees weighed in on Gutenberg.</p>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 05 Sep 2017 23:31:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: August 2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/the-month-in-wordpress-august-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6420:"<p>While there haven’t been any major events or big new developments in the WordPress world this past month, a lot of work has gone into developing a sustainable future for the project.

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href="http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href="https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span>If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i><span>submit it here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 01 Sep 2017 10:02:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids 2017 Sells Out, Organizers On Board for 2018 Event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74039";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8631:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordcamp-grandrapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The 4th edition of <a href="http://2017.grandrapids.wordcamp.org" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> was held last weekend at Grand Valley State University’s downtown Pew Campus. After a brief hiatus following previous events in 2012, 2013, and 2014, the WordCamp is back in action with first-time lead organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/mysweetcate" target="_blank">Cate DeRosia</a> at the helm.</p>\n<p>Tickets sold out shortly before the event and the vast majority of them were local to Michigan. DeRosia estimates that 40% came from Grand Rapids and 60% of attendees were within an hour radius. She published the camp&#8217;s details with a local events webpage and set up a Facebook page to increase local awareness. Organizers also received contacts from the WordPress dashboard events widget and the local MeetUp announcement.</p>\n<p>Despite being a relatively small WordCamp with 144 attendees, organizers had enough speaker submissions to fill three tracks with topics ranging from development and design to freelance best practices and scaling a business. Attendees characterized the organizers as &#8220;connectors&#8221; who have a natural gift for helping people and businesses get to know each other. DeRosia said one of the unique things about the lower Michigan WordPress community is its dedication to helping each other succeed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The core group in Grand Rapids, and really across the lower half of Michigan, is highly experienced and sincerely dedicated to helping people,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;No one is fighting to be top dog on the pile. No one&#8217;s gloating. Meetups and WordCamps are ways to give back, to encourage and grow others in the community. The focus is on the opportunities that WordPress can provide anyone and a willingness to share their years of hard earned experience to help others succeed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said the organizing team&#8217;s goal was to provide a little something for everyone and &#8220;an opportunity to learn what can be done and take that home to foster and grow at each individual&#8217;s own pace.&#8221; The event was marked by the friendliness and enthusiasm of the volunteers and provided several breaks and social times for attendees to exchange ideas and build relationships with others in the industry.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">4yrs ago I attended <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcgr?src=hash">#wcgr</a> and knew no one.

DeRosia&#8217;s teenage daughter Sophia, who has been volunteering at camps for years, also joined by contributing the event&#8217;s wapuu design and helping with operations. In the short interview below she describes how she came up with the idea for the wapuu and why she enjoys getting involved in WordPress events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DeRosia had just four months to get the event organized and said she relied heavily on information and resources from other WordCamp organizers in Michigan. She stayed with the same venue from previous camps, which she said met her criteria for making things convenient for attendees: lunch was easily available, parking was easy to find (and free), and it was within a reasonable walking distance of hotels and the after party. The camp had no issues getting local sponsorships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our sponsors were amazing,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;We came in late to the schedule and still had the sponsorship we needed with out any problems. It helps that as an organizing group we&#8217;ve created friendships in the community, but most of our sponsorship was local or regional which really helped cement the idea that another WordCamp in the area has value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said with the number of people who left talking about the next event, she anticipates there will be another WordCamp Grand Rapids in 2018 and she hopes to help again as lead organizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew tackling the &#8216;unknowns&#8217; of this first one (and doing it in a short time frame) was going to be emotionally difficult for me personally, but I also realized that most of what I was planning for this year would simply be able to move over into next year,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;In a sense, I was planning much of the next camp while planning the first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a first-time organizer, DeRosia said she was impressed by the volunteers, speakers, and attendees&#8217; positive attitudes and their willingness to help given the short time frame.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aside from being terrified of what I didn&#8217;t know, it was actually a very positive experience,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;I had tons of encouragement from our organizing team and the community at large. I was really able to build on the success of the first three Grand Rapids WordCamps, WordCamp Ann Arbor, and the newest area WordCamp in Jackson (MI). I had serious doubts that the community would even care about having another WordCamp (Was I just wasting my time?), but they proved that it&#8217;s a wanted commodity.&#8221;</p>\n\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155129"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155129.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-sara"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-sara.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-br"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-br.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-jjj"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-jjj.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers2"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers2.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154730"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154730.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154854"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154854.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155040"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155040.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 21:08:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 1.0.0 Introduces Drag and Drop for Adding Image Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74447";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-0-0-introduces-drag-and-drop-for-adding-image-blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3151:"<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/" target="_blank">Gutenberg 1.0.0</a> was released this week as another iteration in the beta period that will continue on with 1.1 next week. Design lead Tammie Lister said the team decided &#8220;not let numbers set expectations&#8221; and will carry on at the same pace with weekly releases.</p>\n<p>One of the most visible UI updates in version 1.0 is the new ability to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2447" target="_blank">add image blocks by dragging and dropping them into the editor</a>. They can be placed directly within the content (between blocks) and also onto the image block placeholder. Gutenberg includes a blue line indicator for dropzones where users can place an image.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gutenberg-image-upload.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After testing I found this feature works smoothly but is a little slow. The slight delay of uploading the image after placing it may leave the user confused about what is happening. However, feedback on this particular pull request indicates that the team is working on displaying an immediate reaction to the image having been dropped, instead of waiting for the upload to finish.</p>\n<p>This release also <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2452" target="_blank">merges the paragraph and cover text blocks</a>. Contributors agreed that the two blocks could be easily combined and the colors and font size options from the previous cover block have now been added to the block settings sidebar.</p>\n<p>A few other improvements in this release include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reworked color palette picker with a “clear” and a “custom color” option</li>\n<li>Further improvements to inline pasting and fixing errant empty blocks</li>\n<li>Added thumbnail size selector to image blocks</li>\n<li>Added support for url input and align and edit buttons to audio block</li>\n<li>Restored keyboard navigation with more robust implementation, addressing previous browser issues</li>\n<li>Added align and edit buttons to video block</li>\n<li>Show “add new term” in hierarchical taxonomies (including categories)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the experience of writing within Gutenberg is improving, and the 1.0 release announcement includes an animated gif to demonstrate a user typing in the paragraph block:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/typing.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The editor is getting better at staying out of the way when a user is writing, but the slightest mouse move within the paragraph block will slide all of the block&#8217;s surrounding controls into view. This experience can be a bit jarring, but it may be inevitable unless more of the UI can be buried under the inspector. The paragraph blocks currently display the most commonly used controls for writing text content, but I could see plugins hooking into this to create different types of writing experiences that either add more controls or pare it back to something more minimalist.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:42:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"WPTavern: WordPress.org Now Allows Plugin Authors to Specify a Minimum PHP Version Requirement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74438";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-allows-plugin-authors-to-specify-a-minimum-php-version-requirement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2585:"<p>Although WordPress core currently maintains backwards compatibility with PHP 5.2.4+, plugin and theme authors are not required to do so. When developers include features that require more recent versions of PHP, it can break sites or cause otherwise unexpected behavior. As part of a larger effort to encourage users to upgrade their PHP versions, WordPress.org now allows plugin authors to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/" target="_blank">specify a minimum PHP version requirement</a> in the <code>readme.txt</code> file with a new Requires PHP header.

It also complements WordPress’ Core PHP team&#8217;s recent efforts to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-to-add-new-page-educating-users-on-benefits-of-upgrading-php" target="_blank">educate users about the benefits of upgrading PHP</a>, as the minimum supported version was released 10 years ago and hasn&#8217;t received security patches for nearly seven years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a plugin developer (who maintains my plugins in my spare time), it is becoming increasingly difficult to build new functionality that works in older versions of PHP,&#8221; Paul Gilzow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/#comment-43314" target="_blank">commented</a> on the announcement. &#8220;There are some things that simply cannot be done in the older versions, and in those cases, I have to build out functionality to check PHP versions and disable those features. That takes time and energy away from building out other new features.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress Core Committer Sergey Biryukov said the next step is exploring the possibility of <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934" target="_blank">displaying a notice to users when they cannot install a theme or plugin</a> due to their installations not meeting the required criteria. Ideally, these notices would include host-specific instructions to assist users in getting their sites upgraded to a newer PHP version. This particular move could make a significant impact on the wider WordPress community, if popular plugins start triggering notices requiring newer versions of PHP.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 18:13:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"HeroPress: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2064";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:158:"https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60068:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/083017-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: You can''t always win.

The word ‘retire’ could be little confusing. Does that mean I am going to take leave from all of my ventures permanently? Will not be involved with anything day to day basis. And will be walking out in my beach-shorts in broad daylight, or vacationing endlessly anywhere in the world? </span></p>\n<p><span>In some sense, Yes, in some sense, No. The kind of office I have I could literally go in shorts though, and my life has given me the opportunity to vacation as I want, almost!</span></p>\n<p><span>But, yes, I am talking about taking leave from most of my ventures, at least not being involved day to day. And kind of taking a break to reflect more into life. I have been working tirelessly for a decade. I need some kind of breathing space, it&#8217;s not exactly what you think though. It’s kind of reboot. I will keep expanding the idea throughout the article.

As this article is entirely about me, you have to tolerate a lot more. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" /></span></p>\n<p><strong>This is going to be the biggest ever article published in HeroPress!</strong></p>\n<h2><b>So, I always wanted to do WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>No, obviously not. In my childhood I always wanted to be <strong>a scientist, a Physicist</strong> to be exact. And it&#8217;s not just like an aim-in-life, I was literally very serious. I was always into Space Science. Later it grew more into Physics. To give you an idea how serious I was, let me tell you something. While going through some old boxes, I found out some paper-cutting from back in 1993(I was in 3rd Grade back then), about coverage of different space exploration, news about Pioneer, upcoming plan on a Probe in Saturn. I literally had a file to collect those. Back in that day, that&#8217;s what you could do most, without any internet, and from a remote part of <strong>Bangladesh</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>I was not extremely good in school, it&#8217;s not like what you read in the story, never stood 2nd type(always 1st)! It&#8217;s more like I never stood 1st type! But I was good in math, I was always progressing, and the main blessing I had in my life was support of my parents, unlikely most parents in our time, they never pushed me into things, never tried to push their judgment into my life. When I advanced from one Class to another, making some progress, they were happy with it, and I always made progress. So, they were happy, I was happy being a mediocre-student. But the issue was, in my mind, I was the best. I know how childish it sounds, but I was really a child back then! I always thought that I am best if I try enough, and if I was given enough opportunity. So, Instead of trying to do best in the Class, I focused on many things, like starting a Detective Company to Secret R&amp;D Team, and none of those was a joke, we were serious. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Reading!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I always loved reading, and I was extremely lucky to have so much opportunity to read in my childhood. My house has some collection of children’s book, some cheap but interesting translation, my parents always brought me books on every possible occasion, as that&#8217;s what would make me happy. When that was not enough, I practically sneaked into most houses in the neighborhood. I was in 7th Grade at that time, and if a neighbor had an older kid they would have more books, and good part was if you show interest in reading books, and return it carefully, they would not mind to open up their bookshelf door for you, and most of them even loved me for this. Later on, I also finished up most of my relatives collection in the same town. Later on when in high-school everyone around knew I love books. Later on, this grew on my friends as well. I was lucky to have good childhood friends, who also enjoyed books as well. So, we would gift books to each others birthday, so we could read it ourselves. And few of my friend was very good students, and they always got some scholarship money, so we spend everything in our school life on books!</span></p>\n<p><b>So, what was I was reading? Everything!</b></p>\n<p><b> &#8211; Everything!</b></p>\n<p><span>Starting from Children’s story later grew into Detective Story, Science Fiction, and later into the adventure story, literature, whatever comes into my hand. One interesting thing I also did from the very early stage, keeps track on what I am reading. It probably came from my hobby of collecting Stamps. We used to make notes and categorize our collection. So, I started doing the same for Books. I made a notebook, started noting and making a list of what I am reading, later on, I started to make some remarks, note, what I liked, what not. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Writing!</b></h2>\n<p><span>In my teenage life writing took even more meaning. I was always good at expressing myself, and creative writing. But when one of our best friends left the country, and the only way to communicate was to write letters, so, we started to do that. It took different turn very soon. We were enjoying writing letters so much, few of us in the same class who we see every day also started writing letters to each other. However, it was nothing like a love letter or anything related to the affair, we were writing about anything, everything. At one point we were in a competition who could write the longest letter. In this competition, one of my friends wrote a letter to me (again from the same class, sitting almost on my next desk! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" /> ) over 50 pages, and to defeat her I wrote an over <strong>100-page long letter</strong>! </span></p>\n<p><span>*If you are wondering what I wrote in those 100 pages &#8211; I have a very large family, where my relatives of great-great-grandfather’s cousin’s and their family are still very connected and if you saw me talking with any of them you would think they are my 1st Uncle or Aunt. So, what I did is wrote about my whole family tree, describing family history and later on describing each and every member I could remember! In my house we had a very old “Family Birth Register” (জন্ম কষ্টি খাতা), dating back in the early 1900s, I even took help from it!</span></p>\n<p>Over all this had a different impact on our life. I don&#8217;t know how hard it is to believe, but I was into Bangla Literature, specially poem as well, I even had a notebook full with my own poem! One of our classmates even wrote a full-blown 150+ pages novel in that age! And I am still enjoying writing!</p>\n<p><b>Dramatic changes in my Educational life!</b></p>\n<p><span>As described earlier, </span><span>I was average in studies</span><span> but not extremely good. And I was happy about it! All my </span><span>close friends were very good students and would achieve the first or second position in class every time. Whereas, I was happy being in the 8th or 10th position. But as said in my mind I was the best!</span></p>\n<p><span>Our educational system requires you to memorize and write as it is. But I was driven into reading books, and other things (also including playing Cricket seriously). I never tried to focus on memorizing anything. And from childhood, teachers grow an impression of what to expect from a particular student. So, for an example, my social science teacher knew for years what to expect from me, and it&#8217;s very hard to get past that impression. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was advancing from Grade 8 to 9, I took part in a Scholarship exam. </span><span>We prepared for a year. Only a handful of us was participating from our school, I was among those few, but I had literally zero chance to get the scholarship. I was not very bothered about it at all. But during the exam, we had to travel to another town to the exam, and it was in the month of Ramadan, and I did not break my fast. It was hard, I had 2 exams in a single day. When I came back home one day with my father, my mom was sad seeing me so tired and drained out. But was happy that I was still fasting. Then she told me something very simply, which started a chain-reaction in my life. She told me, &#8220;You think of yourself so highly, you spend all of your time with those same kids, who are doing so good in school. But if you really think of yourself so highly, why not try to reflect that in your grade?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Maybe it&#8217;s very normal for parents to talk like that. But as my parents never compared me with anybody or always let me do in my way, I kept on thinking about this. </span><span>What clicked in my mind was that, i</span><span>f I am really good, I should be able to do good in any circumstances, if this requires me to memorize everything I could do that. If I want to be really that good, and be a good scientist, I need to learn to cope up and fight in any situation. </span></p>\n<p><b>So, I changed myself, was even memorizing books, that I absolutely did not like!</b></p>\n<p><span>In grade 9 &amp; 10, I studied very hard. I changed my lifestyle a lot. I changed the way I write in exam paper to change the impression of my teacher. Before I was always like studying in my mind, not writing what I just read, I forced myself in writing those answer I just read, it was very hard and boring at the beginning. But I had a very good private tutor, who guided me in every way. Later on my teachers in school helped in every way possible. In Bangladesh student have to take a part in a Certification Exam after 10th Grade, to advance in College, its called SSC, Secondary School Certificate Exam. I prepared for that. At the end of 10th Grade, I almost had the book fully memorized, I could write as it is, correct to each and every comma and space. I improved my english a lot. I learned some calculous which was not part of our curriculum, just to advance myself for college, and I knew if I had to do better in Physics I need to learn math and Calculous better. I did took part in more Prep test than most other students. And ultimately in the School Preparation Exam, I did extremely well to boost up my energy!</span></p>\n<p><span>Everything was perfect, we took part in the big exam!</span></p>\n<p><b>And I did not get the grade I expected!</b></p>\n<p><span>Interestingly our batch did not get good grades in SSC</span><span>, we were the first batch in a new grading system, and we did not know that even before the exam, so none got perfect grade of 5.0, I got a very average grade(not bad, but not very good either). I was extremely disappointed, broken, but later learned to cope up.</span><span> I realized a good lesson of life that </span><b>&#8211; Even though you may work hard and go to great lengths to do everything possible, still you might have to deal with failures and disappointments.</b></p>\n<p><span>Another good thing also happened in my life too. I moved from the small town I grew up, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishwardi_Upazila">Ishurdi</a></strong>, to the Capitol of the Nation, <strong>Dhaka</strong>, and was able to get a chance in the entrance exam, of all big colleges in the country where I tried. This gave me a huge boost in confidence. I selected to study in <strong>Notre Dame College</strong>, in English Medium of Science. It was another controversial decision I made, for me a kid coming from rather a small town, and from Bangla Medium it was a tough decision, but I stick to it for the future, because I still wanted to be a Physicist, wanted to study further in my life, I knew I had to be in English Medium.</span></p>\n<p><b>I had very hard time at the beginning of College!</b></p>\n<p><span>At the start it was very hard, our whole group suffered a lot to cope up with new curriculum, our first semester in College was the worst. But later we learned to cope up, we were 130 students in our Group (famous Group 8 in Notre Dame College), we all were helpful to each other, not everyone had private teacher in this point, we shared our notes, I was living first time without my parents, I was also dealing with occasional sickness due to not eating properly. So, there was a lot of struggle, but by the end of 1st year, I was dealing with everything properly. I got a good friend circle, I was not only doing well in college, I was also enjoying my freedom and mostly dealing with anything life throws at me!</span></p>\n<h2><b>My Introduction to Computer &amp; Programming!</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, I always loved programming, before entering University I already knew some basic programming, like qBasic, FORTRAN, even some level of Pascal. The kind of society I grew up, a computer was extremely rare before the year 2000. I was kind of lucky to be able to learn basic computer usage starting from the year 1998, got my first computer in 1999. It was so rare to own a computer in that time for that part of the word, that I was not only the first kid in my class to own a computer, but only a handful of people in my town knew how to use a computer. So, though I am not from a very rich or privileged family, extremely lucky that my parents understood the importance in that time. </span></p>\n<p><span>Another interesting aspect was unlike most people, I was not fully taken over by Computer Games. I am not saying gaming is bad, but most of the people I later see own a computer, the main thing they do with it was playing the game all the time. And you have to understand that almost pre-internet period in Bangladesh. I use the internet first in my life back in 2001. I was more into tweaking things, trying to create or modify the software or create very basic type tools. I am super amazed by internet from first interaction. The search engine was in its peak time, discovering new resource was easy. I tried creating my first webpage in Yahoo Geocities back in 2001, wap page generator was also taking shape in coming years. </span></p>\n<p><b>Say Hi to WordPress in my life!</b></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2068 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1-1024x863.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="809" /></a>M Asif Rahman &#8211; Wearing Tees by WordPressian Group!\n<p><span>      I created my first blog back in 2003 in Blogger, but while trying to add a sidebar and customizing home page look, I find it&#8217;s very difficult for me to do anything in ASP.net, then I found WordPress, back in the year 2004. I still remember reading Matt’s blog and write up about how the whole project is moving ahead from b2 cafelog. WordPress was so easy, I hardly knew any PHP in that time, but my HTML and CSS knowledge was well enough for me being able to edit my personal blog. At the start hosting was one issue, but again I was lucky to manage one. Later when WordPress.com came, I migrated my blog over there and was happy at the beginning, as less hassle. I was also heavily involved with forum community. There was some very large community for webmaster and developer, I loved PHPbb and other solution for forums as well. But after experiencing some massive vulnerabilities, which lead to a major data breach, I focused more on personal blogging and soon into web development. Wth WordPress it was extremely easy to create a website, plugin and theming turn out to be not a complex task. The community and developers contributing in this ecosystem were another main factors. I feel very connected with the whole ecosystem, eventually became habituated with this, and started to feel it&#8217;s my comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><b>How I started my career and company!</b></p>\n<p><span>I was using the name A. R. Communication, an as an acronym of my initials (Asif Rahman) back in 2001 as well, but it was nothing serious, no particular business. When in college, to support myself I first started a Marketing Trainee job in a Multi-international company. It was convenient with my college time and location, and they were literally paying to learn things. I started it just the as need of money, but later I enjoyed marketing, corporate training, and even enjoyed sales training as well. But I never took that job a as career choice.</span></p>\n<h3><b>My first venture!</b></h3>\n<p><span>In the year 2003, before even going to Universities I started a full 4 color magazine, printed publication with a close friend of mine. It was a fun ride. The name of the magazine was “</span><b>Fortnightly Tumi</b><span>”, the Bangla word “Tumi” means “</span><b>You</b><span>”! It was a lifestyle Magazine. My family already had a history with the printing business, so I had some experience. We did this business very thoroughly if you consider this as our first venture. We did a proper market study, interviewed potential readers, organized group discussion, and got good funding. And we also started with bang! Hired renowned journalist and writer. I was barely <strong>19 years old</strong> that time, have very experienced people in my team over 50 years old, and managing them was good lesson. All together we published 3 edition, with good marketing trick we were able to sell 10,000 copy nationwide for that last edition, we had over 20 big brands in the country advertising with us. But still, that business did not work out. We had to shut down, as our investor (my friend’s family) want us to focus on our education instead of this, and we were probably way ahead of our time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Too many choices after college!</b></p>\n<p><span>I did fairly good in college, despite being in English medium. I applied for the various scholarship in different university all around the world, and was in a process of ISSB for Airforce as GD Pilot, the whole process was lengthy, and I was only doing it for 2 reasons.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>One of my friends asked me to collect the form, as it was close from my house, and I thought why not fill up together.</span></li>\n<li><span>GD Pilots also get the chance of studying Aeronautical Engineering and even switch to Engineering in future, and they will have a chance to study higher in that subject, which could open up my door for getting into Space Science. All for free, paid by Govt.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Interestingly I get past all the test and selected finally. But they informed me, I have to stay in GD Pilot as a cadet and will be commissioned in 2 years, but have to think Pilot as a career, I was confused, I never enjoyed or felt the passion for speed before in my life. And we had few months time before joining the Force.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the meantime, I got so many opportunities in various universities. And one of my dream to study further in Physics was too close, as I got a chance in Uni Penn, and got a scholarship there as well. I had few other opportunities at Canada and Australia. I even applied for Visa for Australia as well, but later had to decide against all of those for some family and personal reason. </span></p>\n<p><span>I ultimately left Air Force as well, me &amp; my parents agree that&#8217;sts not a good career choice for me, given the option I had. I got a scholarship at North South University in Electrical &amp; Telecommunications Engineering. And as I started my company seriously at beginning of 2004, then a University that offers Open Credit, where I am able to choose my workload, it was just convenient. So, out of all promising option, I almost chose the risky one, to make my own company and study in Bangladesh, at least for the Bachelor.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The inception of ARCom:</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, ARCom is the short version of A. R. Communications. As I found making website too easy with WordPress, and a new found talent was helping me as well. </span></p>\n<p><span>Just as I never waste time on gaming, rather enjoyed my time to tweak things, creating new application. Instead of most people, when they visit a new website, they look at the shiny look, or how good or better information it provides, whenever I visit a good site, I was always thinking how they are making money, how is this built and sustained. This quest has helped me making our first successful business. It took years, it did not turn into something very big in a night. During University years I did make many different kinds of websites, in that time I started earning first from selling websites. That was during the year 2005 or 2006, it was long before Sitepoint turn into Flippa, back in the shining days of DigitalPoint! I used that money to buy more domain. I hired my university classmate to work with me. The first outsider I hired in my company was a designer, as I needed help in there. Later it kept growing over the year.</span></p>\n<h3><b>First Big Success:</b></h3>\n<p><span>Though I already enjoyed some good (if not very big) payday by selling a website, point to note here, I was selling website as a business, not like you design a site and sell, its more about creating a business, create a process and sell it for a 2X &#8211; 5X yearly profit. But my big success came after 2008. Everything was turning so well, I was done with my University. My company was already a Team of over 20 people, with an office of 2500 square feet space. We started </span><a href="https://thetechjournal.com"><b>The Tech Journal</b></a><span>, it worked so well in every aspect. As I was into writing blogs and also into the gadget. After the first iPhone release I was involved in many ways, from working with the secret group who were Jailbreaking each and every firmware, also new kind of responsive websites, I was also into News &amp; those kinds of stuff. And because of my quest to understand how a thing works, I had a good grasp already into Content Distribution. Facebook and other Social Media are playing a role in content and distribution already. It all helped.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Tech Journal became very big!</b></p>\n<p><span>Within 6 months of start, we ranked within top 20k website. I was enjoying the ride to play with monetization and taking things into next phase. At one pick point, we were ranked even within top 4000 websites in Alexa. I had a good team with me. I finished my university already, 3 of my University friend was working with me full time. We all shared same vision for The Tech Journal, and it kept on growing. Because of our experience with WordPress we kept on innovating, for us we could build anything in WordPress, I had a solid Development team as well.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Marriage &amp; Beyond!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I got married at 2009, I was 25 years old back then. I don’t know if there is any perfect age for marriage, but I felt that was the right time, I was doing good in business, was looking for more stability in emotional life as well. I suddenly found my long lost childhood friend, <strong>Bipasha</strong>, whom I did not have any communication for past 13 years, but suddenly fall in love and we decide to get married. <strong>Just like that!</strong> I will not go into details here(it&#8217;s already too big) how we studied together since 1st grade and got detached when we were in 7th Grade, but still got married 13 years later. We started a new life, life was never better!</span></p>\n<p><b>Moving Further with WordPress:</b></p>\n<p><span>Over the year WordPress kept growing so was I. I was writing, blogging, building things with WordPress. WordCamp was already something, but I was not able to attend or participate as I was still in Universities, but after finishing up, I decide to get more involved. I spoke in my first WordCamp in WordCamp Melbourne. For many years I was also very vocal about security and optimization, so I started to get so many opportunities into speaking and participating in various things. I still remember I spent one crazy summer in the US, participating 6 WordCamps, visiting 9 States and 13 cities in the process, starting from Boston and finishing at San Francisco! </span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2069" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1-1024x514.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="482" /></a>WordCamp SF 2014 &#8211; Mission Bay Conference Center\n<p><span>I was very lucky to be able to speak at last ever WordCamp San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pursuing more into Investment!</b></p>\n<p><span>It&#8217;s mainly because of <strong>The Tech Journal</strong>, I was involved in many tech conferences, and always getting the pitch from various startups. And my new grown circle of friends from WordPress and various other tech scenes, I already established a good connection in Silicon Valley. It was in the year 2009 when I made my first Angel investment, the credit must go to my friend circle, it was years before Angel List, there was offline syndicate where folks will share investment opportunity. But I really loved talking with young entrepreneur and seeing how new business works. I kept my focus in my sector, the field I understand. So, I mainly invested in tech. Out of several investments, one of my lucky ones was Facebook, I was able to invest in <strong>Facebook</strong> before their IPO, not very early, but still Pre-IPO stage, it was one of my lucky breaks. As I was already doing good in my business I tried to utilize it. I did not start investing because I had too much cash laying around, I started because I liked those opportunities, I wanted to help those ideas or startups.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Moving into the US:</b></h2>\n<p><span>I started another business in US, where my partner was from Orlando, I spent one Thanksgiving with my Wife in Orlando, really loved the place, people, and we already got a long term Visa, and had full opportunity to live anywhere we want. My company in Bangladesh was already in a stable phase, and as I was traveling heavily for years, my team was used to being managed remotely, so it was not a hard decision. But staying far from parents was hard. So, what we started maintaining both houses in Bangladesh and Florida. For years we spend some part of the year in US, rest in Bangladesh. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Child &amp; Changes in Life!</b></h3>\n<p><span>Like everybody else our life was bound to change when we had baby. In year 2014 we were getting for our first baby. We decide to stay in US, because of better medical facility and my involvement in different things. Just a month after speaking at WordCamp San Francisco in November we were blessed with <strong>Aaniyah</strong>. Actually, our life already changed when we were planning and waiting for the baby. I was feeling the work routine I have would never let me spend the time I want to have with my baby.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2070" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh-1024x691.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="648" /></a></p>\n<h2><b>Analytify &amp; A New friendship!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I became friends with </span><a href="http://www.adnan.pk/"><span>Muhammad Adnan</span></a><span> online back in 2014, he was working with his premium Plugin <a href="https://analytify.io/"><strong>Analytify</strong></a> back then. I found this as a real good project and started talking with him, giving him various advice, and we later decided to team up, and we released the first free version of Analytify WordPress plugin on 1st January 2015. It was a success, it completely revolutionizes how people use Google Analytics in WordPress. Later Adnan visited me in the US in 2015, and together we attended WordCamp Miami and had a good trip and drive to Key West! The most interesting part of the friendship lies somewhere else. I am a Bangladeshi, and Adnan is Pakistani. Both of our nation has a very bad past. Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan, back in 1971 we fought for about 9 months, and millions of people died in the process before we got Freedom and Declared Independence from Pakistan. But it creates a life long enmity between two countries. I know for an outsider it does not make sense to keep some feelings for that long, but for its very personal for us. Our country lost so much in that war, even if you speak about just my family, My Grandmother lost half of her family in that war, Bangladeshi especially have a very strong opinion about any Pakistani. But meeting Adnan, becoming friends, and working together made me realize few interesting thing, this feeling, this agony against any Pakistani was one-way. Most of the Pakistani did not have any idea what their Government or Army did, they hardly have idea about their Ancestors’ doing. They rather still consider us Brother! Some of the history he never knew, they never read in their history book. I would never know this if it&#8217;s not for </span><b>WordPress</b><span>, we would never meet, this change in understanding for both of us never happened.</span></p>\n<p><span>And we together kept on growing <strong>Analytify</strong>, as the best Google Analytics Plugin in WordPress, and planning many interesting things together.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Coming Back to Bangladesh!</b></h2>\n<p><span>While I was staying and mostly investing in the US, I started investing in some interesting Teams in Bangladesh from the year 2012. Over the year, a few failed, but some really kept on growing. In the year 2016, in Pre-Trump period we were expecting our 2nd Baby, and it was too hard for us to manage alone in the US, and we both were missing our family. I want my kids to grow up having their family close to them, the way I grew up. I want my parents to feel close to them. Occasionally when we visited Bangladesh with our first child, I was quite blown away the way they loved and took care of the baby. It all made sense if we spend some more time in Bangladesh, and have the Baby in here. And the weird things going on with the US also motivated my decision. The kind of craziness we are seeing in the US, actually did not start just by having Trump elected. It goes way back. We were living in a  very peaceful neighborhood in Florida, a small town called Orange City, near Daytona Beach! But we could still feel the change in air. Our parents have a pending Immigration Application for near a decade, they are on the que to become US citizen anyway. We first tried to have them with us, but US Embassy in Bangladesh rejected that application, for absolutely no reason. And my other venture was already growing in Bangladesh. So, all together we decide to stay in Bangladesh for awhile, we moved in mid-2016.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Welcoming Aadiyah into the Family!</b></h3>\n<p><span>We had our 2nd Baby <strong>Aadiyah</strong> in September 2016, a bit ahead of time, my wife got little too sick, but we were able to handle everything because of having family together. We moved into a large Duplex house, to have enough space for the baby. We feel we are complete as family and never been this happy before.</span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2071" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a>Complete Family!\n<h1><b>weDevs &amp; My Legacy!</b></h1>\n<p><span>I will discuss later my involvement in Bangladeshi WordPress Eco-system. But back in 2013 I first met <a href="https://tareq.co/">Tareq</a>, a very talented Bangladeshi Programmer, running a successful WordPress product company. He and his Partner <strong>Nizam</strong> built an amazing company, and they had few very interesting and super successful products for WordPress. I started helping as possible from my end, I want them to succeed and pushing them to move forward. I became an official partner and board member of <a href="https://wedevs.com"><strong>weDevs</strong></a> back in 2015. I was helping them to grow internationally and advising them as part of the board. We established a US company and kept on growing. Though I was in WordPress for very long time, my main company <strong>ARCom</strong> was never serious into WordPress Product. I released some of <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/asif2bd">our work</a> in Open Source via WordPress.org Plugin Directory, and with my growing experience with <strong>Analytify</strong> made me dig more into WordPress products.</span></p>\n<p><span>Somehow at the end of 2016, <strong>Tareq</strong> and I was looking at our numbers for <strong>weDevs</strong> in 2016, we noticed something very important. Three of us spend more time digging deep into the numbers and re-analyzed our process and priorities. Soon we all came into understanding we have to take things forward with <strong>weDevs</strong>, the growth of the industry is very important if we want to be big in future this is the right time. They proposed to me if I could take over as <strong>CEO</strong>. Nizam was running weDevs successfully as CEO for years, and I never thought seriously about running another company, and my retirement plan was already in place. But we found this could be the best thing we could do in the year 2017, where I have little over 1.5 years before my planned retirement. </span></p>\n<p><span>So, I jumped into the ship. I always dreamed to make a rocking and successful company in WordPress product space, and it was my chance. And as it&#8217;s already a running successful company, my goal here to build a legacy, instead of just making a profitable company, built a sustainable company, and proper team, a fine management, that could grow into future, that could </span><b>outgrow us</b><span>, something even bigger than us combined. </span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2073 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a>weDevs new office &#8211; Reception Area from inside &#8211; WordPress Flavoured!\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>So, I took over <strong>weDevs of CEO</strong> in January 2017, I took 2 months as the transition period and blend fully into the day to day system. We announced this officially in the month of March. Dhaka is a very jam packed city with the highest number of people living in per square miles in the world. We were already a Team of about 25 people. I still had few other business that I have to take care. So, we moved to a new large space. A total of 5000 square feet space, fully open, we built a unique office that could sustain us for next few year. I moved my house and office in the same area, called <strong>Mirpur DOHS</strong>. Me, my partners, and almost 12 of us together moved into this area together. As we now live within 2 min distance from the office, the Traffic could not bother us at all. We gave the option for our employees to move into too. We paid the moving cost, we even adjusted salary if they faced any increase of cost for housing or anything. We took time, but now our new office is complete, it&#8217;s one very interesting WordPress themed workplace.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2074" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We are growing further, our team of 25 people will soon <strong>become a team of  50+</strong>. We are working on new stunning products, we just launched a brand new super fast Form Builder plugin named <a href="https://wedevs.com/weforms/"><strong>weForms</strong></a>. It will revolutionize the way people build forms and create anything from just a simple contact form to organize a quiz. Our team built it entirely on Vue.JS, as a single page app. It&#8217;s unbelievably fast, almost nothing we have seen so far inside WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our Team internally working very hard to update our existing product and we are working on some new things that I am incredibly looking forward to. Before I join, weDevs did not have a marketing team, we ran entirely autonomous. In last 6 months, we have built a sustainable Content &amp; Marketing Team. I am working tirelessly with my CTO &amp; COO to build a new culture. We have a two-way feedback evaluation process. I created a kind of unique in its way, a grading system where the company could give feedback to an employee, on exact point, and inform directly where they need to improve. It&#8217;s a kind of algorithm I have developed over the years and really helps you to make a happy and working team. In the same way, Employee also have the opportunity to give feedback to the company directly &#8211; about what makes them happy, how a company could help him grow more, or if the company is addressing every concern properly. We do this quarterly basis, and review in each quarter, so the improvement could always be tracked, graphed and addressed properly.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Bangladeshi WordPress Community!</b></h2>\n<p><span>This is another very proud thing I would like to talk about. When I first had a very detail conversation with Matt Mullenweg, back in 2011, he was very happy that I attending so many WordCamp, and be that much involved with the community, he asked me about WP community back my country, and told me if we are able to have a good group, a nice meetup and eventually a WordCamp, he will try to attend. I found a new role for myself, over the year we grew Bangladeshi WordPress community. Locally we have very growing and engaging WordPress Group, called WordPressians, we have over 21,000 Members in Facebook. We are a team of 15 Admin/Organizer who maintains everything, and it&#8217;s an open group so always evolving. Over the year, we 15 became very close to each other, and we all consider each other as best friend. We contribute in Open Source together, we hangout together, attend various WordCamps around together now, we plan day out together as well. This is another blessing happened to our life mainly because of WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2075" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881-1024x417.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="391" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Starting from 2013 we are official meetup chapter in Dhaka. We organized over 15 meetup, where each and every meetup of our could be considered little WordCamp, with 4-6 session, and had 150-300 attendees. We organized all of our meetup in our own platform, a WordPress plugin we created, so everything happened at &#8211; WPressians.net, not at Meetup.com, we did it with direct permission from WordPress Foundation. We have made WordCamp Application starting from 2013. And I even faced Organizer interview twice in 2014.</span></p>\n<h3><b>But the sadness!</b></h3>\n<p><span>There is one thing that hurt me a lot. Though me and our organizing team worked so hard to grow Bangladeshi WordPress community, but due to some miscommunication, we still don&#8217;t have any WordCamp yet. The foundation failed to take timely measures to proceed with our WordCamp application, we faced repeated issues in getting the proper timely response from them. Out of frustration and years of waiting back in 2015, we organized a CMS Conference in Dhaka, where we had over 10 speakers, and there were over 1500 attendees. So our team has proven their position, but things took so long from the Foundation. I wrote to foundation much time, there is one on-going conversation, still, we hope for the best, this the way Foundation handled our communication, shows the lack-of-attention clearly. I am almost devastated in this and very hurt! When I first attended and spoke in WordCamp Melbourne in 2011, I was the first Bangladeshi to ever do so. I but I kept on pushing. Now there is over 10 from even just our organizing team where they attended in various <strong>WordCamps around the World</strong>. Last year we attended WordCamp Singapore with a team of 9 people from Bangladesh. We are gaining experience, we are driven, but still lacking behind because of Foundation, sadly! I attended over <strong>50 WordCamps</strong> worldwide, I helped to organize over 10 WordCamps in various cities, but could not organize a single one in my home country for 6 years, this keeps bugging me all the time!</span></p>\n<h1><b>My Future Plan!</b></h1>\n<h2><b>Plan to retire by my next Birthday!</b></h2>\n<h3><b>weDevs to keep on Growing!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I am here at weDevs to create and fine tune the process and build the vision. I already described what&#8217;s happening in there. From my start as CEO we are seeing about 15% month to month growth in revenue and about 20% in market reach, We will keep on doing so and beyond. And we will probably get more result in long term, and building team, forming up a new culture and getting result certainly take more than 6 months.</span></p>\n<p><span>So far the plan is to me stay in Day to Day involve up until June 2018. This is not an exact day plan, could change with time. But possibly by September!</span></p>\n<h2><b>ARCom being Autonomous!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am running ARCom without much of daily maintenance for awhile now. I have Team Lead, Editors, Managers in place, that&#8217;s running their wing successfully for awhile now. There are few new plans and things my Team working, but all team has a lead, which they ran with ownership, and mostly sustainable. There are some places where we need some work, I hope it will be done by that projected time.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Geeky Social, 3rdBell and my other venture!</b></h2>\n<p><b>Geeky Social</b><span> has a solid team, and they are running amazingly. I am very proud of our team. I am part of the board and now serving as Chairman, and probably will continue to do so. I hope by next 6-9 months we will be even stronger financially, our month to month growth is already steady and growing, we are clear it will grow a lot from there. One of our core success is to grow beyond a cash-hungry business, which is incredibly hard if you are involved in Digital Media, and buying. But we got past that and now everything taking shape. I am very confident in the team and looking forward.</span></p>\n<p><a href="https://3rdbell.co"><b>3rdBell</b></a><span> faced so much issues over the year, but now we have a solid platform, the founders are incredibly motivated. Me and other investors are looking forward. I am still involved as Technical Director, this role could extend for the time being when we go through some changes, but we have solid plan to move forward, and by mid-next year, it should be i a  different height.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Me &amp; WordPress &#8211; going forward! </b></h2>\n<p><span>I will have people to maintain my plugin, and provide even better support, and few of them are even joining next month, so it will be well taken care of. I will shift the community role mostly to new people and others. Next 9 months I will dedicate to have more Contributor from my community and circle. I will literally incubate contributor,  from Core contribution to Docs and Community team. I will drive more into sharing my experience and finding over the decade. Besides writing, which I think is my superpower(!), but still under used, I will drive more into Speaking. Those are my next upcoming  Session, if you are happened to any of those WordCamp, please say Hi!</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>WordCamp Colombo, Sri Lanka &#8211; 23rd September</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b><a href="https://2017.colombo.wordcamp.org/speaker/m-asif-rahman/"><span> Making Million in WordPress Plugin But Not Being Evil!</span></a></p>\n<p><span>      2)  <strong>WordCamp Ahmedabad, India &#8211; 7th October</strong></span></p>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b> <a href="https://2017.ahmedabad.wordcamp.org/"><span>You heard content is the king, but are you paying attention to Content Distribution?</span></a></p>\n<p><span>If you read so far, you should understand how relevant both topic to my life! </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>How could I financially sustain this?</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am thinking, planning and working on this retirement plan for awhile now. The main question I got asked how could I financially sustain. I don’t know what kind of impression you have got so far by reading about my life. Yes, I own several successful ventures, running a very growing and profitable business, I also invested in the 20+ venture and was extremely lucky to enjoy some exit from the investment. But not in very big scale. Some of my investment looks promising, but that does not make me very rich in cash. So this plan further is not about having tons of cash in hand laying around, it&#8217;s more about having sustainable and ongoing earning. I do certainly have some exit I am looking forward to but my plan will not depend on it. I am confident now I could easily go beyond this month-to-month type calculation! </span></p>\n<h2><b>The Hardest Part!</b></h2>\n<p><span>When you grow business for over a decade, the main challenges are people. Like some successful venture, I also have businesses that are not cash-positive but has people involved with it for years. When you run a business, you become responsible for those people, their family depends on your decision, that type of responsibilities will limit you sometimes taking logical business decision. And really relying so much into people, and the fear of let going control could be hard dilemma any Entrepreneur could feel. </span></p>\n<p><span>But over the year I learned,<strong> sometimes you have to let go to get things done for future, sometimes you have to take a leap of faith</strong>. So, I practiced that for some time now. I am positive that things will work out, and won&#8217;t break apart.</span></p>\n<h1><b>Reason: Why I am doing this?</b></h1>\n<p><span>In some ways I feel I am doing this for very long time. I have built team, product, faced hard time, and also enjoyed when things work out, I have gone through this circle so many times. There is always hard time and I have seen how it all ultimately always worked out. I kind of want to get out of this circle. Sometimes I feel tired. Though for a person like me who single handily started everything, broke so many barriers, it&#8217;s hard to get me tensed. I know how to deal with pressure, hard time, shitty situation. In some ways I am resistant to those. But when I reflect everything in my life I am very proud what I have done, what I have Achieved.</span></p>\n<p><b>Monetary wealth did not make me rich! </b><span>But the experience and relation that I cultivated did. I feel rich because of this. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was still a teenager, dreaming to be a physicist, I had a very thorough vision of my future, I wanted to finish my PhD by age 25. Later in the course of life I became Entrepreneur. Then my goal was to become a millionaire  by age 25 and have a stable family. I was successful in that. I have the vision to built amazing WordPress team and product, I am doing that right now. </span></p>\n<p><b>I want to move on, I would like to see greater meaning of life. </b><span>That does not mean what I am doing is great, it&#8217;s just going beyond. I always thought life has a bigger meaning for me, I always felt privileged, the kind of life I had, most people from my demography could not have, so I have bigger responsibilities! </span></p>\n<h2><b>How &#8216;Big&#8217; is WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>WordPress is biggest CMS and No.1 solution to make Website, but how many businesses do you see worth over a $100M in WordPress Ecosystem? Or over $50M? Not much. And because of so much recent #WPDrama, one thing is very clear, we have a long way to grow. I kind of feel to make it too big, we even limited ourself as well. I do see the power struggle inside the community as well. The most respected person in the community, now have very large number of haters, and for few semi-valid reasons.<strong> That is sad, maybe we all need to rethink!</strong></span></p>\n<h1><b>What will I do in future?</b></h1>\n<p>Maybe I will <strong>drive deep into science</strong>, I will be still 34, even enough time to study something new! <span>Maybe I will just enjoy the break for awhile. Maybe I will try to find the better meaning of life. Or maybe will write a book, I don’t know, I want to keep the option open, have an open heart. I do certainly earn this freedom myself, I am very grateful to the list of endless great people that helped me throughout the decade of my career.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Your kids to reflect You!</b></h2>\n<p><span>We all want our kids to be like us, we want them to reflect us in a good way, and go beyond. But If we are not involved in every process of their life how could this happen? If you let your family, mainly wife to entirely take care of your kid how they are going to learn from you? Do you really believe just giving 1-2 hours a day will do the trick? It&#8217;s way more than that. I want to be an integral part of my kids’ life. I want to be fully involved in their process of growing up. In this whole thing, there is nothing related of deciding fate of their life. I have no expectation of making my kids something, I am fully open, they will decide their destiny, their own venture. I just want to help them understand this World, </span><b>be their Dad</b><span>, be the friend they could play with, be the teacher they need, as long as they need.</span></p>\n<p><span>I will spend more time with my family, my 2 young daughters really need more of me, they will be 4 &amp; 2 by next year. They will go into school, perfect time for me to jump in.</span></p>\n<h1><strong>Conclusion: For You!</strong></h1>\n<p>If you came this far reading this, you could probably tell I enjoyed writing! My routine hardly gives me more option to do it regularly. I was meant to write this HeroPress article last year but was too busy, and the timing was too near of the 2nd baby&#8217;s birth!</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect others to try to retire early, but having a choice in life is important. Try to look back. Why do you work? Is it because of earning money? Just to survive, just to sustain your family? This should not be the purpose of human life. I believe our Creator created us for a reason, <strong>we are not meant to live and die selfishly like an animal. There should be more meaning of life other than trying to buy luxury!</strong></p>\n<p>There is a Ted talk describing Humans, how evaluated to be Human, one of the core reason was we cooked, and gathered and stored food, so we spent less time like other Gorillas to try to find food and spend most of the days for that purpose. We cooked, it was easy to chew, and it gave us more free time, so we were able to innovate! Interesting theory, but surely intriguing.</p>\n<p><strong>Life is not always about achieving it all. It&#8217;s sometimes about the journey. You can&#8217;t always win. You have to learn from the journey and move on.</strong></p>\n<p>When I look back I do see, my decision to invest worked out many ways. <strong>As I diversified my venture it was a good move.</strong> I made many mistakes and described in details here as well, but I tried to learn and reflect that in my further life. I am who I am, because of the journey. I don&#8217;t regret any part of it. If I had the chance would I have done it differently? I don&#8217;t know, maybe that could be a different journey. My life is wrapped up entirely with WordPress, I am and will always be proud of that. But maybe I need to give myself a fair chance to see the world clearly. For past 13-14 years, I have worked every day on an average 14 hours of more, I still stay at the office for over 12 hours. But I don&#8217;t do it because I have to, I do it because I enjoy it. But this is taking too much of my life, I am too swamped up. This break is necessary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I really like to thank Topher &amp; HeroPress for giving me this opportunity and pushing me on writing this. I was very confused as it turns out this BIG. I thought it was just 2500-3000 words, I wrote almost on the fly, so was not looking at word count. Probably this is kind of my thing, if an idea is clear in my head, I don&#8217;t have issues putting it into letters.</em></p>\n<p><em>Topher told me this is twice the size of the previous longest essay in HeroPress. <strong>I am glad if you read it completely! That&#8217;s also an achievement!</strong> Then why not spent few second more to say Hi in the comments, so I could know who read this far!</em></p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Retiring%20Young%20From%20Bangladesh%2C%20Thanks%20To%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F&title=Retiring+Young+From+Bangladesh%2C+Thanks+To+WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/083017-150x150.jpg&description=Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/" title="Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/">Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 00:00:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"M Asif Rahman";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Akismet: Akismet and Drupal, Together Again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1960";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/08/29/akismet-and-drupal-together-again/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1569:"<p>Akismet is used on millions of WordPress sites, but it isn&#8217;t only used with WordPress.

We have challenges (user frustrations with publishing and customizing, competition from site builders like Squarespace and Wix) and opportunities (the 157 million small businesses without sites, aka the next big market we should be serving). It’s time for WordPress’ next big thing, the thing that helps us deal with our challenges and opportunities. The thing that changes the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic has been moving towards offering better support for small businesses with its 2015 <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce" target="_blank">acquisition of WooCommerce</a> and steady commercialization of Jetpack, with plans targeted at business owners. The company is poised to capture even more of the self-hosted small business market by allowing customers to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem" target="_blank">tap into WordPress&#8217; third-party ecosystem</a>.</p>\n<p>However, many vocal opponents to Gutenberg (and the changes that will come along with it) are concerned that the project is being developed chiefly to serve Automattic&#8217;s customers and corporate interests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg has been mainly introduced by one particular company which seems to be in urgent need to compete with other SaaS businesses,&#8221; WordPress theme development company owner <a href="https://www.mhthemes.com/" target="_blank">Michael Hebenstreit</a> said. &#8220;That’s fine, but then keep it as a plugin for at least 1-2 years, put it on WordPress.com (to gather real live feedback and usage data) and nobody will have any issues with that approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg addressed concerns that Gutenberg is being developed for Automattic&#8217;s customers in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587598" target="_blank">reply</a> to a similar comment on his post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There definitely is a contingent that seems to think that, but if you think through it logically it doesn’t make sense: if it were just to benefit Automattic it would be far easier and more advantageous to just do Gutenberg unilaterally in Calypso, where it would primarily benefit WordPress.com,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Doing it in wp-admin and core first involves a lot more discussion, public feedback, backwards compatibility concerns, and breaking a lot of new ground for how core uses Javascript, and because it’s in core the benefits will accrue to all hosts of WordPress, many of which directly or indirectly compete with Automattic. We are reading and trying to learn from all the negative feedback though, even when it’s from people who haven’t used Gutenberg much yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those who build websites for clients have voiced concerns about how Gutenberg will affect their businesses, whether the brand new interface will drive users away from WordPress. Developers and product owners are eagerly awaiting more answers on what it means for existing plugins and themes in the ecosystem, as the project has yet to iron out some of the more technical details regarding extensibility and support for metaboxes. This naturally raises concerns about Gutenberg&#8217;s timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready, not vice versa,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We still have target dates to help us think about scope and plan for all the supporting documentation, translation, and marketing efforts, but we’re not going to release anything until Gutenberg is something the team working on it agrees is ready.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress users have been conditioned to anticipate releases on a regular schedule but the new approach to core development will allow for the next major release to wait until the targeted features are ready. Mullenweg confirmed in the comments of his post that Gutenberg will ship with a legacy interface to offer backwards compatibility for PHP metaboxes that have not yet updated to be JS-powered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some things like toolbar buttons will definitely need to be updated to work with Gutenberg, other things like Metaboxes there will be no problem to provide a legacy interface for a few releases,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;But I would say that plugin authors should start updating their plugins in late September if they want to benefit from Gutenberg’s launch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the most prevalent concerns that remains is React&#8217;s licensing issues, which came to a head after the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook’s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses for Apache PMC members. Facebook&#8217;s engineering directors considered re-licensing the project but <a href="https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license" target="_blank">decided against it</a>, citing &#8220;meritless patent litigation&#8221; as the reason behind adopting the BSD + patents license. The WordPress project has yet to announce its stance on the decision.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We anticipated a decision on React around the Apache deadline (closer to now), will have more to announce about WP and Gutenberg’s approach here in the next few weeks,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>He also reiterated how invested he is in the WordPress project and ecosystem as a whole. His post elaborated on the many benefits he anticipates for plugin, theme, and core developers, agencies, users, and hosting companies. He challenged the WordPress community to see Gutenberg in the same light.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My life’s work is improving WordPress,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I firmly believe that Gutenberg is the direction that will provide the most benefit to the maximum number of people while being totally in line with core WordPress’s philosophies and commitment to user freedom. So keep giving us your feedback, and let’s push through the fear together. It’s worth a little discomfort to change the world.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 18:01:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"Matt: We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47503";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9263:"<p>Movable type was about books, but it wasn’t just about books.

It’s about freedom, about possibility, and about carving out your own livelihood, whether it’s by making a living through your site or by working in the WordPress ecosystem itself.

It’s time for WordPress’ next big thing, the thing that helps us deal with our challenges and opportunities. The thing that changes the world.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>For those who don’t know we kicked off the Gutenberg project around the beginning of the year, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/06/4-8-and-whats-coming/">I talked about it and we did our first public releases in June</a>, and the team has been doing <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-editor/">weekly updates</a> of the public beta plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">that&#8217;s available for anyone to try out in their wp-admin</a>.</p>\n<p>When Johannes Gutenberg’s press came out, people mostly used it to print the same religious text monks had been copying. It wasn’t until ten or fifteen years later that people started innovating and trying their hands at new kinds of writing, and the wheels of change started to spin faster. Now it’s WordPress’ turn to do the same. Gutenberg meets our challenges and opportunities head on while simultaneously benefitting everyone who makes a living working in the WP ecosystem. It’s about a lot more than just blocks. Our Gutenberg moves every part of the WordPress ecosystem forward:</p>\n<p><strong>Developers and agencies</strong> will be able to create interactive templates that clients can easily update without breaking things or dealing with custom post types: Imagine a custom “employee” block that you can add to an About page that includes a picture, name, and bio. They’ll be able to replace most meta boxes, and they’ll get a chance to update old code or clients to work in this new paradigm.</p>\n<p><strong>Plugin developers</strong> will be able to completely integrate into every part of WordPress, including posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars without having to hack TinyMCE or squeeze their entire feature behind a toolbar button. Today, every plugin that extends WordPress does it in a different way; Gutenberg’s blocks provide a single, easy-to-learn entry point for an incredible variety of extensions. Some folks have already begun to port their plugins over, and are finding that they&#8217;re easier to build and have a much improved UI. I&#8217;m looking forward to highlighting those stories as we get further along and more people write about them.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme developers</strong> won’t need to bundle tons of plugins or create their own page builders. There’ll be a standard, portable way to create rich layouts for posts and guide people through setup right in the interface, no 20-step tutorials or long videos needed. Every theme will be able to compete with multi-functional premium themes without locking users into a single theme or compromising their experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Core developers</strong> will be able to work in modern technologies and not worry about 15 years of backwards compatibility. We’ll be able to simplify how menus, widgets, and the editor work to use a common set of code and concepts. The interface will be instantly responsive.</p>\n<p><strong>Web hosts</strong> will have better signup rates, as Gutenberg opens up WordPress to an entirely new set of people for whom WordPress was too complex and hard to set up before. (Remember our goal: to democratize publishing.) Their churn rates will go down: they’ll stop bleeding customers to Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace, and fewer people will abandon their sites because it was too hard to make things look they way they wanted.</p>\n<p><strong>Users</strong> will finally be able to build the sites they see in their imaginations. They’ll be able to do things on mobile they’ve never been able to before. They’ll never have to see a shortcode again. Text pasted from Word will get cleaned up and converted to blocks automatically and instantly. (I pasted the first version of this post from Google Docs and it worked <em>great</em>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f44c.png" alt="👌" class="wp-smiley" />) They’ll start manipulating their sites in ways that would have taken a developer. They’ll be able to move from blogging to using WordPress as a CMS without missing a beat. Editing posts will just work; they’ll write more. They’ll learn blocks once, and then be able to instantly use and understand 90%+ of plugins.</p>\n<p>I could go on about how photographers will be able to create rich galleries, parallax images, and better portfolios, or how poets will finally be able to preserve whitespace as they write, but you get the idea. It’s big. It moves the WordPress ecosystem forward, but it also moves the whole web forward.</p>\n<p>Which is scary! Because change always is, and this is a big one. But a scary thing is usually a thing that leads to growth, if you can push through it. Ten years ago, agencies and developers worried that software like WordPress would ruin their business because clients wouldn’t need help updating their sites any more, and would maybe even just start building their own sites. But their worse fears didn’t come true — instead, it created new opportunities for everyone.</p>\n<p>(People were worried when the printing press was invented, too. A Swiss biologist warned against the “confusing and harmful abundance of books,” but I’d say it all worked out in the end.)</p>\n<p>This is not to say that nothing will go sideways with Gutenberg, or that people’s concerns about it are unfounded. Making something people want is really hard to do and easy to mess up — we definitely have in the past. I share many of the concerns or worries with today’s version of Gutenberg, and we’re working to mitigate them. Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready, not vice versa. We still have target dates to help us think about scope and plan for all the supporting documentation, translation, and marketing efforts, but we’re not going to release anything until Gutenberg is something the team working on it agrees is ready.</p>\n<p>And as we work, we’re listening: feedback on core and feature plugins gets read, heard, and considered. Every review of Gutenberg, even the rude ones, has a response. Seven months of vigorous and public debate, chats, tickets, and code changesets brought us to where we are today, and there will be  a fair amount more before we can present the Gutenberg vision in a mostly-complete state. I welcome it; apathy would worry me a lot more than disagreement or controversy.</p>\n<p>Creating great software will never make every person happy. We’re not creating The Perfect Product, we’re choosing a path between many good options, weighing all of the inevitable trade-offs that come from a change, listening, shipping, and then doing it all over again. Iterating. My life’s work is improving WordPress. I firmly believe that Gutenberg is the direction that will provide the most benefit to the maximum number of people while being totally in line with core WordPress’s philosophies and commitment to user freedom. So keep giving us your feedback, and let’s push through the fear together.

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href="http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href="https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">submit it here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></i></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"WordPress 4.8.1 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/wordpress-4-8-1-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 21:26:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4875";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:366:"After over 13 million downloads of WordPress 4.8, we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of WordPress 4.8.1, a maintenance release.

Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress core’s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program.

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>. You can also visit <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">the project’s GitHub repository</a> to report issues and contribute to the codebase.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">Bridget Willard <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/21/proposed-wordcamp-editorial-calendar/">has proposed an editorial calendar</a> to assist WordCamp organizers with publishing content for their event.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">A new kind of niche WordCamp, <a href="https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp for Publishers in Denver</a>, has opened ticket sales.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">The WordPress iOS app was updated with <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/an-all-new-media-library-for-the-wordpress-ios-app/">a fresh, new media library</a> this month.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">It looks like <i>Underscores</i>, the popular WordPress starter theme, <a href="https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/">has a bright future ahead of it</a>, with a renewed vision and new committer.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">The always-inspiring Tom McFarlin <a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress">has released a simple autoloader for WordPress</a> that looks very useful indeed.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">After a bit of a discussion on Twitter regarding the differences between WordPress.org, WordPress.com, and Jetpack, <a href="https://helen.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/restaurant-vs-meal-kit-vs-grocery-shopping-or-wordpress-com-vs-jetpack-vs-wordpress-org/">Helen Hou-Sandí came up with a great analogy</a> and an interesting post about it all.</li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400">If you’re interested in contributing specifically to the JavaScript or PHP areas of the WordPress core codebase, then the new #core-js and #core-php channels in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> are perfect for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please </i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i>submit it here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4865";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"WordPress 4.8 “Evans”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:49:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:373:"An Update with You in Mind Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!

Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8BDWH3QG-1-video" width="632" height="342" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly?

These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

Gutenberg engineers will be rewriting the new editor to use another JavaScript framework and Automattic plans to rewrite Calypso as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#8217;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#8217;t be published, and instead I&#8217;m here to say that the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg clarified that Automattic has been happy with React and that the company&#8217;s general counsel <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367" target="_blank">didn&#8217;t think they would ever run into the patent issue</a>. He also commended Facebook on being &#8220;one of the better open source contributors out there&#8221; and for making their intentions clear. Ultimately, Mullenweg decided that he wasn&#8217;t comfortable with the larger WordPress community inheriting the patents clause:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the long-term consistency with core is worth more than a short-term hit to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses, many open source project leaders and developers <a href="https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies" target="_blank">petitioned Facebook to consider re-licensing React</a>, as many React-based projects are now having to be rewritten. <a href="https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license" target="_blank">Facebook decided it wasn&#8217;t budging on the patents clause</a> and opted to continue protecting its own interests, fully recognizing that it may lose some React community members.</p>\n<p>In the past Mullenweg has been outspoken about how Automattic was betting on React. Many in the community considered WordPress adopting React to be a foregone conclusion, given that both Calypso and Jetpack&#8217;s new admin interface were built on it, as well as WordPress&#8217; new Gutenberg editor. In making the costly decision to rewrite Gutenberg and Automattic&#8217;s products in another library, Mullenweg has demonstrated he is willing to lead the WordPress project in a direction where the community can feel confident about continuing to use and extend the software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#8217;re always listening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg could certainly use the extra time and may gain a new crop of contributors, given that the learning curve for the new library isn&#8217;t likely to be as steep as learning React.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, WordPress core contributors had <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-debate-heats-up-contributors-narrow-discussion-to-react-vs-vue" target="_blank">narrowed their considerations for a new JavaScript framework to React and Vue</a>. It appears that <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> is still a strong contender. After a commenter on Mullenweg&#8217;s post suggested switching to Vue, he replied that it has been frequently suggested and that the team has met with Evan You, Vue&#8217;s lead developer.</p>\n<p>When I <a href="https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion" target="_blank">interviewed Evan You in June</a>, he said he didn&#8217;t have enough perspective on WordPress core to make an unbiased recommendation but offered feedback on some technical issues being discussed at the time. He also clarified some common misconceptions about Vue, which WordPress&#8217; React proponents had been using as leverage in their arguments against adopting it.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg also confirmed in the comments of his post that <a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank">Preact</a> is another library under consideration. Preact.js is a lightweight 3kB alternative to React that uses the same API but is MIT-licensed. Some are already speculating about Preact being the front-runner for the replacement, as Gutenberg already has a branch devoted to trying it.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a Preact “try” Gutenberg branch. But there is no Vue.js “try” Gutenberg branch. <a href="https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b">https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" /> (@carlhancock) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/908510738066657281">September 15, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, Mullenweg&#8217;s comment that the decision &#8220;will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year,&#8221; seems to only be feasible if the team rewrites the project using Preact.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For Gutenberg, not Calypso. I’d take a friendly bet like some booze. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/908539602645827584">September 15, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Public reactions to the news that WordPress is shifting away from React have so far been overwhelmingly positive. Many are thankful and relieved that Mullenweg made the tough decision to change course and select another library after investing so heavily in React.</p>\n<p>The discussion regarding the new framework continues behind closed doors and is not open to the public, although a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2732" target="_blank">pull request for using Preact in Gutenberg</a> is open on the project&#8217;s GitHub repo and some community discussion regarding the library selection is happening there.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 05:39:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: On React and WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47558";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3758:"<p>Big companies like to bury unpleasant news on Fridays: A few weeks ago, <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/">Facebook announced</a> they have decided to dig in on their patent clause addition to the React license, even after Apache had said <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303">it’s no longer allowed for Apache.org projects</a>. In their words, removing the patent clause would "increase the amount of time and money we have to spend fighting meritless lawsuits."</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m not judging Facebook or saying they&#x27;re wrong, it&#x27;s not my place. They have decided it&#x27;s right for them — it&#x27;s their work and they can decide to license it however they wish. I appreciate that they&#x27;ve made their intentions going forward clear.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Automattic used React as the basis for the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">ground-up rewrite of WordPress.com we called Calypso</a>, I believe it&#x27;s one of the larger React-based open source projects. As our general counsel wrote, <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367">we made the decision that we&#x27;d never run into the patent issue</a>. That is still true today as it was then, and overall, we’ve been really happy with React. More recently, the WordPress community started to use React for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/17/dev-chat-summary-february-15th-4-7-3-week-3/">Gutenberg</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">the largest core project we&#x27;ve taken on in many years</a>. People&#x27;s experience with React and the size of the React community &#8212;  including Calypso &#8212; was a factor in trying out React for Gutenberg, and that made React the new de facto standard for WordPress and the tens of thousands of plugins written for WordPress.</p>\n<p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#x27;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#x27;t be published, and instead I&#x27;m here to say that <strong>the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library</strong>. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p>\n<p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the <em>long-term consistency</em> with core is worth more than a <em>short-term hit</em> to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p>\n<p>I think Facebook’s clause is actually clearer than many other approaches companies could take, and Facebook has been one of the better open source contributors out there. But we have a lot of problems to tackle, and convincing the world that Facebook’s patent clause is fine isn’t ours to take on. It’s their fight. </p>\n<p>The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision. We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#x27;re always listening.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:59:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"WPTavern: First WordCamp Dublin Set for October 14-15";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74595";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"https://wptavern.com/first-wordcamp-dublin-set-for-october-14-15";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4577:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dublin.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.ireland.com/en-us/what-is-available/sightseeing/destinations/republic-of-ireland/dublin/dublin-city/">Ireland.com</a>\n<p>Following up on the success of WordCamp Belfast last October, the WordPress community in <a href="https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">Dublin will be hosting its first WordCamp October 14-15</a>. Both camps <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-meetup-groups-in-belfast-and-dublin-are-planning-wordcamps-for-2016-and-2017" target="_blank">began the early stages of planning last year</a> and the two communities have shared some of the same organizers across their teams to help get these new camps off the ground in Ireland.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will be held at <a href="http://business.dcu.ie/" target="_blank">DCU Business School</a> and ticket sales will be capped at 250. In truly affordable WordCamp tradition, tickets are only €35 and include access to two tracks of speakers on both camp days, catered lunch, and an after party on Saturday night in Dublin City Centre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given it’s our first WordCamp Dublin it’s difficult to select a venue when we’ve no idea about how many people would like to attend,&#8221; co-organizer Colm Troy said. &#8220;But demand so far has been great so if you want a ticket I’d recommend getting one sooner rather than later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the camp&#8217;s five organizers are also part of the Dublin WordPress meetup, which is fairly active with 25-30 people attending regularly. They meet the first Thursday of every month and host a local speaker to teach attendees something new. WordPress developers generally gravitate towards the more technical talks, while WordPress users are more interested in talks about improving and promoting their websites.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will feature one track with advanced WordPress, coding, and development topics and a second track that covers aspects of running a business, growing website traffic, podcasting, and other related topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;​The Dublin WordPress community, based on what I’ve seen and experienced elsewhere (Buenos Aires, Paris, Vienna, UK, Italy), is pretty unusual,&#8221; co-organizer Rodolfo Melogli said. In addition to co-organizing the local WordPress meetup, Melogli also organizes the Dublin E-commerce and WooCommerce Meetups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have complete beginners, who after years of using other CMSs have finally decided to start using WordPress,&#8221; Melogli said. &#8220;We have passionate bloggers, who have been exploiting the SEO and content management features of WordPress since the very beginning. Then, we&#8217;ve got successful themers, popular plugin developers and experienced WordPress freelancers. Making sure everyone is catered for at each WordPress meetup and at the upcoming WordCamp is our biggest challenge and main priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The beautiful thing about the WordPress community, and especially in Dublin, is that you can have a successful theme seller sitting beside a complete beginner. And they both have things to share.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers have just announced the <a href="https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/speakers-2017/" target="_blank">full lineup of speakers</a> for the WordCamp and co-organizer Colm Troy said the team was &#8220;blown away by the quality and quantity of excellent speaking applications&#8221; they received.</p>\n<p>The camp&#8217;s designers have created a new &#8220;blocky&#8221; style wapuu for the occasion to accompany the event&#8217;s modular design theme. They were aiming for a Lego-like wapuu while incorporating the cosmopolitan landmark &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_of_Dublin" target="_blank">Spire of Dublin</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-dublin-2017.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;​We have a couple of ideas floating around that will definitely add a unique Irish aspect to WordCamp Dublin but it’s too early to let the cat out of the bag on those yet,&#8221; Troy said. &#8220;In terms of what people can expect, Dublin and Ireland in general has a well earned reputation as one of the most welcoming places in the world. In many ways, our welcoming spirit is closely aligned with the ethos of the WordPress community and I think it’s going to be a really special weekend for attendees regardless of whether they’re new to WordPress or WordCamp veterans.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:15:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: GitHub Partners with Facebook to Release Atom-IDE";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74752";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wptavern.com/github-partners-with-facebook-to-release-atom-ide";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3269:"<p>GitHub <a href="http://blog.atom.io/2017/09/12/announcing-atom-ide.html" target="_blank">announced</a> the launch of Atom-IDE this week, a new set of packages that extend its open source JavaScript-powered code editor to include IDE-like functionality.

This has been a frequent <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-is-painfully-slow/36298" target="_blank">topic</a> of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8989606" target="_blank">discussion</a> for several years and its creators admit that <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-feels-slow-or-is-consuming-too-much-cpu-or-memory/32662?source_topic_id=36298" target="_blank">performance isn&#8217;t one of its strongest features</a>. However, sometimes extreme performance issues can be caused by a package that a user has installed.</p>\n<p>Atom partnered with Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://nuclide.io/" target="_blank">Nuclide</a> project developers to develop the new <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui" target="_blank">Atom IDE UI</a> package that uses Atom’s <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom-languageclient" target="_blank">atom-languageclient</a> library in displaying features supported by the <a href="http://langserver.org/" target="_blank">language server protocol</a>. Users who want to get started with Atom-IDE will need to install the Atom IDE UI package as well as an IDE language support package (i.e. <a href="https://atom.io/packages/ide-php" target="_blank">ide-php</a>).</p>\n<p>Using Atom-IDE currently requires Atom Beta 1.21+. In the future the team plans to add support for more languages, which will most likely happen through outside package contributions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the help of our community, we plan to expand the number of languages that Atom-IDE can support and make it possible for you to run and edit applications, making Atom-IDE a true IDE,&#8221; Damien Guard said. &#8220;We hope to see future language support for the great languages out there including Rust, Go, Python, etc.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 02:12:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Display Widgets Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Malicious Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74768";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6033:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-widgets/" target="_blank">Display Widgets</a>, a plugin with more than 200,000 active installs, has been removed from WordPress.org due to its authors inserting malicious code. SEO consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-law-9444b637/" target="_blank">David Law</a> was the first to bring this issue to the attention of the plugin team after discovering that Display Widgets was inserting content into sites from external servers and also collecting visitor data without permission.

According to their independent investigation, the plugin included a backdoor that allowed the plugin author to publish spam content to the sites where Display Widgets is installed. It also prevented logged-in users from being able to see the content.</p>\n<p><a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2017/09/malicious-code-display-widgets/" target="_blank">Pagely banned the Display Widgets plugin</a> from its hosting platform this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For our customer’s safety, we have banned the plugin from our customer sites&#8230;The plugin will remained banned on our network until a time that we see someone has taken responsibility for the plugin and the future of patching its code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets had recently changed hands, as it was acquired from the team that created Formidable Forms.

They do not receive a notice in the WordPress admin about the plugin having been removed from the directory. Since Display Widgets was a fairly popular plugin, there are likely many sites that still have it active and those website owners are probably unaware of the spam content they are publishing.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the plugin team issued a notice that <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-2-7-is-safe/" target="_blank">Display Widgets 2.7 is a clean version</a> that restores the plugin to version 2.0.5 before the malicious code was added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will be leaving this version deploying updates, however at this time we will NOT be allowing for its adoption. The second owner has effectively destroyed any trust a person might have in the plugin.</p>\n<p>Note: You CANNOT visit the page or download it as a new plugin for a reason. This plugin is done. It’s not supported, it’s not worked on, nothing. So if you have it, upgrade. Otherwise, find something else to use.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets is now likely to end up in the graveyard of abandoned plugins, but there are many other options for adding conditional widget display to WordPress sites. Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/widget-visibility/" target="_blank">widget visibility module</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-options/" target="_blank">Widget Options</a> by Phpbits Creative Studio, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-sidebars/" target="_blank">Custom Sidebars</a> by WPMU Dev, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-aware-sidebars/" target="_blank">Content Aware Sidebars</a> are a few popular alternatives on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The plugin team does not currently disclose why certain plugins have been closed or removed from WordPress.org, but they are working on providing better communication for users. One meta trac <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2627" target="_blank">ticket</a> requests that closed plugins have a public page instead of disappearing completely. In another related <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2860" target="_blank">ticket</a>, plugin team member Mika Epstein has proposed that when plugins are closed or disabled, there should be a dropdown for WordPress.org admins to select a reason why. She suggested the following as available options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Issue</li>\n<li>Author Request</li>\n<li>Guideline Violation</li>\n<li>Licensing/Trademark violations</li>\n<li>Merged into Core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue with Display Widgets was fairly public as users posted about their investigations on the WordPress.org support forums and various companies issued warnings about it. However, many plugins are disabled without the public knowing why. Even a short explanation like the proposed examples above would be a major improvement over leaving WordPress.org plugin users in the dark. It would assist site owners in knowing whether they need to prioritize looking for an alternative or simply wait until the situation is resolved.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:08:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"HeroPress: Making My Own Normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2098";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:114:"https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=making-my-own-normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8262:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine." /><p>As long as I can remember being normal was my only goal in life. If only I could be normal, then everything would be alright. There was not a lot wrong in my life when I was a kid, growing up in a small dutch town. I had a normal family with 2 parents (a mum and a dad) and a younger sister. My life was pretty normal. The problem was: It didn’t feel normal; I didn’t feel normal. You see, everybody was going through life living by certain rules and I lived my life not knowing those rules. Nobody told me, but apparently they told everybody else.</p>\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\n<p>When I was 35 I got diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. I cannot tell you how relieved I was after receiving such a clear diagnoses. All those years working so hard to fit in there was an explanation why I didn’t. Why I couldn’t. That was a big deal. It was not that I wouldn&#8217;t that I didn’t try hard enough or was to lazy. There was something different about me why I couldn’t. Not understanding the rules of life? Being clumsy and inappropriate in social situation? Being obsessed about some things and totally not interested in others? It was all part of the package.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting the right diagnosis changed everything and at the same time it didn’t change anything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problems I had to face were still the same. The way to handle them just got more clear. And there was help. I started reading books, I started therapy and I started working with a coach to find a way to integrate this new knowledge into my life. I started looking at what I needed (what??) and finding ways to take care of myself. I really thought this was it. I found the keys, I could learn the rules and finally be a normal person.</p>\n<p>And then I got fired.</p>\n<p>Having a job was a big part of being normal in my head. Getting fired ruined my chances of ever getting there. I was working as an assistant manager in the local library. I liked my job, and the people I worked with and they liked me. I loved going to work. But the library had to cut their expenses and I was one of the people that got fired. It happens but I was completely shocked.</p>\n<p>My experiences with jobs were not good (to put it mildly). There wasn’t one I kept longer than 2 years. You can do the math; I had a lot of jobs since I started working. Some were fun most were not. I got fired many of times. Getting fired was not a new thing. Liking a job and not wanting to get fired and getting fired anyway was what upset me the most. So I decided to start my own company.</p>\n<h3>Taking Control</h3>\n<p>Looking back it was a ridiculous plan but strangely enough, it worked out. I started helping people with their Social Media and building website with WordPress.</p>\n<p>I learned WordPress for fun. I wasn’t interested in computers or tech stuff. I was just a little obsessed with making a website for the domain name my boyfriend gave me for my birthday a few years earlier. I had nothing to say but was totally fascinated by what you can do with a website. It was like magic to me. Some written code turned into a beautiful page, or an ugly one. I wanted to know all about that. Building things with HTML and CSS was easy. Code is logic (and poetry of course;-)). It does what you tell it to do. If it doesn’t you did something wrong. Never a discussion about it.</p>\n<p>I shied away from people. It was too confusing for me now that I found something that was so easy and logical.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I could make money without seeing other people, it felt like heaven.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For a while. This is really what makes this whole thing so disturbing. I want to be alone, but also want to be around other people. I appear to be good with people. A lot of people like me (who knew?!). They have no idea how confusing it is not knowing what the underlying rule set is others are acting by. It’s like interacting with someone from a totally different culture speaking a different language but both of you don’t know that. I got really good at guessing things through the years, but that didn’t make it any less uncomfortable. I also got really scared. Because not all people are understanding and friendly when you try to explain.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>In 2011 I went to my first WordPress meetup. I was shocked! These people did what I did and actually knew what they were doing and talked about it. I was blown away with all this new knowledge and information. I needed to know more and learn more. So I went back into my WordPress cave and studied, practiced and learned more.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe happened for the first time in 2013 in The Netherlands. I signed up as a volunteer. I visited WordCamp NL the year before. As a visitor I didn’t know how to meet new people. That was a lonely experience. I loved the knowledge that was shared but I knew I had to find a way to talk to those people. I figured being a volunteer would give me something to do and a reason to talk to people. And it did.</p>\n<p>I met new people, I was shy, I was scared, I acted totally inappropriate and I was exhausted for a week after the event but I did it. The people were nice. Some seem to like me and I had fun. This was a totally new experience. If only this could normal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I attended more WordCamps, always as a volunteer, that was my safe place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My confidence grew. The number of people I knew grew. The amount of fun I had grew. And never ever did I feel not normal. As my confidence grew I got more visible and things got even better. It’s an upward spiral. This year I held my first talk, at WordCamp London. I was MC at WordCamp EU in Paris en I am on the organising team for WordCamp EU 2018 (BIG things!).</p>\n<p>Did these experiences end my quest to becoming “normal”?</p>\n<p>When I turned 40 I decided to quit the quest. I was done trying to be normal. Not because I became normal but I broadened my worldview. There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine. It took me a while ( and a lot of redirections) to find the one that fits me best.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Making%20My%20Own%20Normal&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F&title=Making+My+Own+Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-150x150.jpg&description=Making My Own Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/" title="Making My Own Normal"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/">Making My Own Normal</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:00:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Wendie Huis in ‘t Veld";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: WordPress.org Adds New Support Rep Role for Plugin Pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74726";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-adds-new-support-rep-role-for-plugin-pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1424:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/collaboration.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress.org introduced a new feature for plugin pages this week that highlights official support representatives.

With billions of dollars flowing through the WordPress economy, tensions are high, as many people support themselves and their families with the revenue earned from products and services that have been built on the existing editor.</p>\n<p>First impressions range from outright rejection of the new editor to those who embrace it and are hopeful for what it will bring to WordPress. For the past several years, most major new features added to WordPress have come through the feature plugin/feature project process where release leads and other contributors decide whether a proposed feature is ready for merge. The Gutenberg project is taking a somewhat different path to core in that Matt Mullenweg has already confirmed that <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-addresses-concerns-about-gutenberg-confirms-new-editor-to-ship-with-wordpress-5-0" target="_blank">Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0</a>, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready. This approach is part of Mullenweg&#8217;s new strategy for core development that makes releases more project-based instead of time-based.</p>\n<p>One of the most common concerns that developers and agency owners have about the plan to include Gutenberg in 5.0 is that they may need to hold back some of their sites from updating. The most vocal opponents have called for a way to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of Gutenberg so that it isn&#8217;t forced on their users.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://valiantchickendigital.com/blog/wordpress-new-coke-moment/" target="_blank">WordPress is about to have its New Coke moment</a>,&#8221; Nate Hoffelder shared his first impressions of the new edidtor after taking it for a test run. He said he appreciates the changes it promises but was unable to figure out how to create the blocks in the demo and worries about the &#8220;average non-techie&#8221; trying to use the interface.</p>\n<p>Hoffelder referenced Coca-Cola&#8217;s attempt to introduce New Coke in April 1985, which quickly ended in consumers calling for a return of the original flavor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My gut feeling is that if users share my frustrations with Gutenberg, they will demand the return of the old interface,&#8221; Hoffelder said. &#8220;But the official release is months and months away, so it is entirely possible that a UX (user experience) expert will force the Gutenberg developers to make Gutenberg easier to use before it is inflicted upon an unsuspecting public.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Users Will be Able to Restore the Old Editor with a Plugin after Gutenberg Lands in Core</h3>\n<p>WordPress will move forward with the Gutenberg editor as the default experience in the 5.0 release, but Matt Mullenweg confirmed in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587616" target="_blank">comment</a> on his blog that a plugin will be available for users who want to restore the old editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg uses TinyMCE, so a better way to think of it is that Gutenberg is a new version of our approach to TinyMCE,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It will be the default experience of WP, for people that want to use something more like what’s currently there we’ll have a plugin they can use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This should bring some relief to developers who will not yet have updated their extensions to work with Gutenberg, as well as agency owners who are not ready to give their clients access to the new editor.</p>\n<p>In his post, titled <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason" target="_blank">We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason</a>, Mullenweg shared his vision for how the new editor will will re-imagine TinyMCE and the advantages it will bring for plugin editors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Plugin developers will be able to completely integrate into every part of WordPress, including posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars without having to hack TinyMCE or squeeze their entire feature behind a toolbar button. Today, every plugin that extends WordPress does it in a different way; Gutenberg’s blocks provide a single, easy-to-learn entry point for an incredible variety of extensions. Some folks have already begun to port their plugins over, and are finding that they’re easier to build and have a much improved UI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For developers who are worried about the compatibility of their metaboxes, Mullenweg said <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587620" target="_blank">a plugin will be available for providing the legacy edit page for metaboxes</a>. One commenter, whose sites are heavily dependent on Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), asked if there is going to be a version of WordPress that will get long-term support for sites that can&#8217;t be upgraded to 5.0 without breaking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There won’t be a version of WP like that, but there will definitely be a plugin that gives you the legacy / old edit page. Make sure to let ACF know that Gutenberg compatibility is a top priority,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Scott Kingsley Clark, lead developer of the Pods plugin, said this support for legacy PHP meta boxes is welcome news for the project but that Pods is also looking to get on board with Gutenberg once the project&#8217;s engineers have a solution for metaboxes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m very excited to start using the new meta boxes from Gutenberg once the API supports it and gives us more to utilize,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;As soon as that’s available, count us in for immediate adoption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite assurances that a plugin will be available to restore the old interface, some are still concerned about how Gutenberg will impact the WordPress ecosystem. The average WordPress user has never heard of Gutenberg and its inclusion in 5.0 will be a major change.</p>\n<p>In a recent article on WPShout Fred Meyer contends that <a href="https://wpshout.com/stop-presses-gutenberg-wordpress-needs-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough/" target="_blank">Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough</a> towards giving users what they really want, which he identifies as front-end editing and the ability to create layouts within post content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;It won’t make WordPress’ core content editor competitive with hosted builder solutions, or even with WordPress’ own themes and plugins (including badly built, bad-for-the-community solutions like Visual Composer.)&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meyer believes Gutenberg has the opportunity to defragment WordPress&#8217; ecosystem of page building tools, but only if it moves towards providing &#8220;a feature-rich, developer-friendly, front-end page builder and content editor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In responding to feedback from the community, Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister has said that the project is currently focusing on editing before tackling the page building experience. The team has also been <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587693" target="_blank">working with the authors of page builder plugins</a> ahead of the next focus on customization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is still a little early to say what will happen to plugins and builders,&#8221; Lister <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587692" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;Initially, Gutenberg is focusing on the editor. The next stage is for the Customization focus (the building of pages). One thing that will need to happen is a lot of testing of existing plugins with Gutenberg. That’s how we can ensure things do work and limit issues. Ultimately, more and more plugins won’t be needed – or at least not so many together to achieve simple things. This benefits users and creates a better, more unified experience for all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If users&#8217; first impression of Gutenberg is that it is unable to deliver on all of the lofty promises of the project, they may return to the old interface en masse. WordPress will then have a battle to convince users to give it a another chance as the experience improves to include customization.</p>\n<p>Multi-column layouts, which are the gateway to page building, are <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-adding-drag-and-drop-and-multi-column-support-for-blocks" target="_blank">not currently within the scope of the first official version coming to core</a>. Gutenberg&#8217;s one-dimensional, vertically stacking approach to designing pages isn&#8217;t very inspiring. This may frustrate average users whose expectations have not been tempered with the understanding that a future version will include an expanded page building experience. A plugin that allows users to opt out until it is an improvement over their current tools is going to be crucial for keeping the community happy.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 04:22:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"WPTavern: “The Final Word” Plugin Extends O2 to Pin a Highlighted Comment to the Top of a Thread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74707";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"https://wptavern.com/the-final-word-plugin-extends-o2-to-pin-a-highlighted-comment-to-the-top-of-a-thread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3311:"<p>&#8220;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-final-word/" target="_blank">The Final Word</a>&#8221; is a new plugin that extends O2 to highlight a comment at the top of a thread. <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/o2" target="_blank">O2</a> is the plugin successor to <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/p2/" target="_blank">P2</a>, Automattic&#8217;s group blogging theme that introduced quick posting from the front page with real-time comment updates.

Hugh Lashbrooke <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/08/24/o2-plugin-request-the-final-word/" target="_blank">created The Final Word for use on the WordPress Community Team blog</a> so that long discussion threads could be summed up in a single comment. He likened the new feature as something similar to the &#8220;accepted answer&#8221; function on Stack Exchange or other support forums where the best answer floats to the top. Discussions in the Community P2 often involve decision making, and the plugin is useful for highlighting the team&#8217;s conclusion on a matter.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/top-comment.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Final Word gives users who are able to edit the post the ability to mark a specific comment as the &#8220;top comment.&#8221; Other features include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The top comment is displayed at the top of the comment list with a ‘view in context’ anchor link</li>\n<li>The top comment is also highlighted in context in the thread</li>\n<li>Only one comment can be selected as the top comment</li>\n<li>The top comment flag can be removed</li>\n<li>Includes basic styling for top comments</li>\n<li>‘Top comment’ label can be translated and/or filtered</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin currently will not work without 02 enabled because of its specific way of handling comments, but Lashbrooke said it may be updated in the future to work without O2. (While O2 is not theme-dependent, the plugin is also not guaranteed to work with every theme and is recommended to be used in combination with the <a href="https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe" target="_blank">p2-breathe theme</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Final Word is now active on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/community" target="_blank">WordPress Community team&#8217;s blog</a> and is available for other teams to activate as well. With the number of O2 blogs that many contributors are subscribed to, there is a massive amount of information and discussion to keep up with. This plugin gives thread authors and team leaders the ability to summarize conversations and keep them more manageable for readers and participants.

Equifax reports that the company has found no evidence of unauthorized activity on its core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases but is offering free identity theft protection and credit file monitoring services to U.S. consumers who enter their last names and last six digits of their social security number into its form.</p>\n<p>Consumers are rightfully wary of the website, as the company is asking for more personal information in order to sign people up for another one of its products.

A username is part of your online identity. It is meant to identify, not verify, who you are saying you are. Verification is the job of the password.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, people do not consider usernames to be secret, often sharing them openly. Additionally, many major online establishments — such as Google and Facebook — have done away with usernames in favor of email addresses, which are shared around constantly and freely. WordPress has also moved this way, allowing users to log in with an email address or username since version 4.5.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress Core Security Team Lead Aaron Campbell clarified this section of the handbook to confirm that the users endpoint is intended to be an open API endpoint that serves public data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It does in fact include usernames and user IDs (among other things) for users that have published posts in a post type that is set up to use the API, but all the data is considered public,&#8221; Campbell said.</p>\n<p>Campbell also said he is wary of entering personal data into the equifaxsecurity2017.com website, but not because it is using WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the fact that it runs on WordPress is a concern from a security standpoint, with the caveat that I don&#8217;t know what ELSE it&#8217;s using,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;&#8216;Equifax&#8217; is a trusted brand, but it&#8217;s not the official Equifax domain and the SSL certificate doesn&#8217;t verify ownership. So you know your data is encrypted, but not necessarily who it&#8217;s being sent to since you don&#8217;t know who owns the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Equifax simply didn&#8217;t build out the information site on its own domain. According to security investigator <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" target="_blank">Brian Krebs</a>, the company appears to have hired Edelman PR, a global PR firm, to handle its public response to the data breach, citing the username publicly displayed by WordPress&#8217; API. Edelman PR opted to use a free Cloudflare certificate to secure the site.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only did <a href="https://twitter.com/Equifax">@Equifax</a> suffer a massive data breach, but their site about the breach is using a free shared CloudFlare SSL cert. ಠ_ಠ <a href="https://t.co/r4bvPpde1i">pic.twitter.com/r4bvPpde1i</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniel Lo Nigro (@Daniel15) <a href="https://twitter.com/Daniel15/status/905953979934187520">September 8, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consumers were also off put by the verbiage of the arbitration clause included in the terms and services of the free credit monitoring, which appears to force those who sign up to waive their rights to participate in class action lawsuits against the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot recall a previous data breach in which the breached company’s public outreach and response has been so haphazard and ill-conceived,&#8221; Krebs said.</p>\n<p>Kenneth White, a security researcher and director of the Open Crypto Audit Project, said on Twitter that he was amazed the site was running stock WordPress but that his comments specifically referenced the sloppy implementation of the site.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">intent wasn''t to blast WP, this is just sloppy—default admin pages, default nginx errors, wonky certs, phish flagged…</p>\n<p>&mdash; Kenn White (@kennwhite) <a href="https://twitter.com/kennwhite/status/906152286908551168">September 8, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Due to how the site was set up, it appeared to many consumers and researchers as Equifax&#8217;s way of stalling or perhaps even scamming those who may have been affected by the breach. Various browsers flagged it as a phishing threat, and some consumers found they were given different answers from the form based on whether they checked with desktop or mobile devices. In responding to the incident with a website that appears to have been hastily implemented for its own convenience and corporate interests, Equifax has missed an opportunity to reclaim any remaining consumer confidence from the public.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 20:04:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: SWFUpload Will Officially Be Removed From WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74660";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wptavern.com/swfupload-will-officially-be-removed-from-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2000:"<p>SWFUpload is an open-source library that was used by WordPress in 2011 and earlier that allowed users to upload files.

Matías Ventura published two video examples to demonstrate where they see Gutenberg headed on its journey towards becoming a full-fledged website building tool. Ventura said this is the long-term goal after the project completes the post and page editing milestone.</p>\n<p>The first video shows how Gutenberg can be used for page building, starting with a blank slate and a theme that defines specific styles for blocks.

People would know all the neighbors, they would pay each other visits every week to talk about what’s been going on in the community and to have a beer or two. It all seemed great until the moment when I got a bit older and went to Junior High School. My hair, unlike all other boys’, was long and I enjoyed listening to rock / metal music, the genre that was considered weird, unknown, maybe even evil.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Suddenly this friendly community started treating me like an alien, someone they refused to treat as one of their own or spend time with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Almost every day I would get some beatings from school bullies, they would pull my hair, call me names, in short &#8211; my life became miserable. I had to find a way to survive, something to focus on.</p>\n<p>That’s when I started spending even more time with my computer, playing Diablo (I even set up a Diablo fan club which became quite popular in Poland) and other multiplayer games that connected me with new people. All these interesting personalities living there, somewhere far away, (and the unforgettable sound of a dial-up modem) made me believe there was something good out there waiting for me.</p>\n<p>Next, natural step was the analysis of how a game could be created. I spent months looking at the code and analyzing its components. There weren’t many tutorials back then, so sometimes it took a while to figure things out. But it all led to building my first website, which was full of tables and hundreds of colorful elements, everything was there! I was so proud of myself! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<p>When I went to High School, I already knew a thing or two about coding and I wasn’t afraid to use it! I moved to a big city, got my first job as a graphic designer and started renting my own apartment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was very young, full of energy and determination to change my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After a while I got another job and another, and suddenly I realized that coding became an essential part of my life. Instead of learning chemistry and biology, I spent my nights learning new ways of improving my skills and finally was offered a pretty sweet job in a huge company, where I led a team of front-end developers. Yes, I was about 19, but I felt so mature. It’s so funny now, when I recall that feeling of accomplishing “everything”, but hey, I knew CSS ‘hacks’ on IE 6, I knew it all!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course, I had heard of WordPress, but none of the ‘true’ coders would use it, so why would I want to dig into that?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, I’m glad someone helped me change my mind. In 2010 my colleague invited me to join him on WordCamp. In Poland WordPress was still considered a cute little tool for creating internet blogs, so I thought going there would be a waste of time, but it turned out to be a life-changing experience. The opportunity to meet people from different countries, hear them talk about the growing possibilities of WordPress made me realize I was in the right place. The fact that a few people I met there are still my friends today only stresses the importance of that event.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It simply dawned on me that it’s not really about the CMS or other technical elements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress turned out to be a tool that led me to meeting a fantastic community of interesting and friendly people. And this was one of the reasons I wanted to delve further into WordPress.</p>\n<p>Two years later I started cooperating with a company based in the United States. Their main tool to build sites on was WordPress, obviously. By the way, I’ve been with this company for over 5 years now and to be honest, I can’t imagine my life without those guys now, but I don’t want to keep you here too long, so let’s move on. I quit my safe, ‘nine to five’ job to the dismay of my parents and started working remotely. Everything was so new, so exciting, but at the same time physically and mentally exhausting. I was doing my master’s degree in e-business and I rarely slept through the night, mostly because my clients were from different time zones.</p>\n<p>To make things more exciting, I applied for a grant from the European Union and registered my own little company in Poland. But hey, I still felt unsated. It took me around a year to decide to move my company to the United States and go there to manage it. Actually, part of this time was spent on convincing my wife to quit the job she didn’t like anyway, but again, no subplots.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To say that moving to the States was easy would be a monstrous lie.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dealing with visas and all types of immigration documents is very time-consuming and caused us way too many sleepless nights, but eventually we got to California! I registered my company (again!), opened a bank account (you wouldn’t believe how difficult it was, so thank you, dear Russian lady for fighting with the system for over 2 hours!), and looked for a place to stay.</p>\n<p>Almost 3 years have passed, I’ve been given a chance to work with amazing people whom I truly admire, and I work for and with a few startups that, I admit, are close to my heart. One of the projects my wife and I are working on is a platform (based on WordPress, of course) that will help freelancers find good, well paid projects. Again, right time, right place, no doubt about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I know you&#8217;ve heard it a thousand times before. But it&#8217;s true &#8211; hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don&#8217;t love something, then don&#8217;t do it.“ (Ray Bradbury)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very often people ask me if it’s all worth it, if I’m a masochist and enjoy burning the midnight oil, but I don’t see it that way. If I have a goal, whether it’s one to create a new website, or learn how to prepare real pierogi (dumplings) for my wife, I’m ready to spend as much time as needed to accomplish it. Sure, if it’s not something I truly ‘feel’, I might not be able to devote 100 percent of my energy to make it happen, but I like to think it’s a matter of making the right choices.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying it’s all rainbows and butterflies right now, I’m not a guy who spends his days surfing or drinking cocktails. To be honest I don’t think I’ll ever be that guy. I’m still working very hard and I rarely take days off, but at least when I go to bed I have a feeling that I’ve done all I could to help others and improve my skills as a front-ender, project manager and most of all, a human being.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Crafting%20the%20Life%20You%20Want&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F&title=Crafting+the+Life+You+Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/090617-150x150.jpg&description=Crafting the Life You Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/" title="Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/">Crafting the Life You Want</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 12:00:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Damian Samolej";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: Jetpack 5.3 Adds PHP 7.1 Compatibility, Better Control for WordAds Placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74547";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-3-adds-php-7-1-compatibility-better-control-for-wordads-placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2636:"<p><a href="https://jetpack.com/2017/09/05/jetpack-5-3-php-7-1-compatibility/" target="_blank">Jetpack 5.3</a> was released with compatibility for PHP 7.1, a task the Jetpack team has been working on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6106" target="_blank">since January 2017</a> after they received multiple reports of <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6629" target="_blank">failures with PHP 7.1 when opcache was enabled</a>. This interfered with XML-RPC requests and some users reported issues managing their sites from WordPress.com and connecting to third-party apps. Downgrading to PHP 7.0 or disabling opcache in PHP 7.1 provided temporary workarounds for many users but this is no longer required as of Jetpack 5.3.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, <a href="https://wptavern.com/jetpack-4-5-expands-monetization-with-wordads-integration" target="_blank">Jetpack added integration with WordAds</a>, WordPress.com’s advertising program. Over the past few years the program has evolved to get better at distinguishing sites with higher quality traffic and allocating earnings accordingly. This correction, along with industry-wide declining ad rates, has given publishers more modest earnings expectations after the first few years of unpredictable payouts. Jetpack 5.3 offers customers on the Premium and Professional plans more control over how ads are displayed.</p>\n<p>This release adds the ability for publishers to display multiple ads and introduces more control options for where they can be placed. Since WordAds pays based on the number of impressions (combined with many other factors) and not the number of clicks, selecting the right combination of placement options is important for success.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordads-jetpack5-3.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other notable changes and improvements include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can preview their sites without leaving WordPress.com</li>\n<li>WordPress.com Toolbar updated to include link to comments</li>\n<li>Omnisearch feature was removed</li>\n<li>Improved performance in the admin by cutting back on unnecessary requests</li>\n<li>VideoPress shortcode includes option to stop video from looping during autoplay</li>\n<li>Fixed compatibility issues with plugins using TinyMCE</li>\n<li>Re-added a filter for Widget Visibility that was accidentally removed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a full list of all the changes included in Jetpack 5.3, check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/#developers" target="_blank">changelog</a> on WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 05:46:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids Attendees Share First Impressions of Gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74538";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-attendees-share-first-impressions-of-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2688:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-grand-rapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>While attending <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> I had the opportunity to interview developers and business owners about their first impressions of the new Gutenberg editor. Many attendees I spoke to had not yet heard of the project but were intrigued and decided to install the plugin on a test site. A few attendees were developers who have already contributed to Gutenberg and are experimenting with extending the editor.</p>\n<p>Those who have tested the beta have varied concerns, depending on how they use WordPress in their professions. Some are waiting to begin testing until the plugin provides a more consistent experience. One of the most common concerns for developers is how the editor will handle meta boxes. Freelancers and agency owners are waiting to see how the new editor will affect their businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How much am I going to have to change what my company does as a business to build websites with this new tool?&#8221; Topher DeRosia asked.</p>\n<p>Agency owner Sara Dunn said she is excited about what Gutenberg will bring to WordPress and undaunted by the prospect of getting clients acquainted to a new interface. She believes the project has a lot of potential to solve some of the most common client frustrations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited about it, because I have a lot of clients who say they can&#8217;t stand WordPress because when they look at the backend and update their pages and posts, it doesn&#8217;t look how it looks on the frontend,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I really think WordPress needs this move to compete in the future, and I&#8217;m excited about where it&#8217;s going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John James Jacoby, one of the developers who has contributed to Gutenberg and experimented with extending it, said he considers it to be a very ambitious project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is probably one of the most important projects that anyone has worked on with WordPress in a number of years, in my opinion,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;My take on it is that everyone has the responsibility to try to influence the direction that it&#8217;s going to take. If we care about the open web and the freedom of how people publish to it, then we should all try to join in and help with its ongoing development and make it as good as it can be if it&#8217;s going to end up as part of WordPress in the coming months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the interviews below to see how attendees weighed in on Gutenberg.</p>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 05 Sep 2017 23:31:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: August 2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/the-month-in-wordpress-august-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6420:"<p>While there haven’t been any major events or big new developments in the WordPress world this past month, a lot of work has gone into developing a sustainable future for the project.

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href="http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href="https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span>If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i><span>submit it here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 01 Sep 2017 10:02:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids 2017 Sells Out, Organizers On Board for 2018 Event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74039";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8631:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordcamp-grandrapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The 4th edition of <a href="http://2017.grandrapids.wordcamp.org" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> was held last weekend at Grand Valley State University’s downtown Pew Campus. After a brief hiatus following previous events in 2012, 2013, and 2014, the WordCamp is back in action with first-time lead organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/mysweetcate" target="_blank">Cate DeRosia</a> at the helm.</p>\n<p>Tickets sold out shortly before the event and the vast majority of them were local to Michigan. DeRosia estimates that 40% came from Grand Rapids and 60% of attendees were within an hour radius. She published the camp&#8217;s details with a local events webpage and set up a Facebook page to increase local awareness. Organizers also received contacts from the WordPress dashboard events widget and the local MeetUp announcement.</p>\n<p>Despite being a relatively small WordCamp with 144 attendees, organizers had enough speaker submissions to fill three tracks with topics ranging from development and design to freelance best practices and scaling a business. Attendees characterized the organizers as &#8220;connectors&#8221; who have a natural gift for helping people and businesses get to know each other. DeRosia said one of the unique things about the lower Michigan WordPress community is its dedication to helping each other succeed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The core group in Grand Rapids, and really across the lower half of Michigan, is highly experienced and sincerely dedicated to helping people,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;No one is fighting to be top dog on the pile. No one&#8217;s gloating. Meetups and WordCamps are ways to give back, to encourage and grow others in the community. The focus is on the opportunities that WordPress can provide anyone and a willingness to share their years of hard earned experience to help others succeed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said the organizing team&#8217;s goal was to provide a little something for everyone and &#8220;an opportunity to learn what can be done and take that home to foster and grow at each individual&#8217;s own pace.&#8221; The event was marked by the friendliness and enthusiasm of the volunteers and provided several breaks and social times for attendees to exchange ideas and build relationships with others in the industry.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">4yrs ago I attended <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcgr?src=hash">#wcgr</a> and knew no one.

DeRosia&#8217;s teenage daughter Sophia, who has been volunteering at camps for years, also joined by contributing the event&#8217;s wapuu design and helping with operations. In the short interview below she describes how she came up with the idea for the wapuu and why she enjoys getting involved in WordPress events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DeRosia had just four months to get the event organized and said she relied heavily on information and resources from other WordCamp organizers in Michigan. She stayed with the same venue from previous camps, which she said met her criteria for making things convenient for attendees: lunch was easily available, parking was easy to find (and free), and it was within a reasonable walking distance of hotels and the after party. The camp had no issues getting local sponsorships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our sponsors were amazing,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;We came in late to the schedule and still had the sponsorship we needed with out any problems. It helps that as an organizing group we&#8217;ve created friendships in the community, but most of our sponsorship was local or regional which really helped cement the idea that another WordCamp in the area has value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said with the number of people who left talking about the next event, she anticipates there will be another WordCamp Grand Rapids in 2018 and she hopes to help again as lead organizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew tackling the &#8216;unknowns&#8217; of this first one (and doing it in a short time frame) was going to be emotionally difficult for me personally, but I also realized that most of what I was planning for this year would simply be able to move over into next year,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;In a sense, I was planning much of the next camp while planning the first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a first-time organizer, DeRosia said she was impressed by the volunteers, speakers, and attendees&#8217; positive attitudes and their willingness to help given the short time frame.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aside from being terrified of what I didn&#8217;t know, it was actually a very positive experience,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;I had tons of encouragement from our organizing team and the community at large. I was really able to build on the success of the first three Grand Rapids WordCamps, WordCamp Ann Arbor, and the newest area WordCamp in Jackson (MI). I had serious doubts that the community would even care about having another WordCamp (Was I just wasting my time?), but they proved that it&#8217;s a wanted commodity.&#8221;</p>\n\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155129"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155129.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-sara"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-sara.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-br"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-br.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-jjj"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-jjj.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers2"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers2.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154730"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154730.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154854"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154854.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155040"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155040.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 21:08:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 1.0.0 Introduces Drag and Drop for Adding Image Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74447";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-0-0-introduces-drag-and-drop-for-adding-image-blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3151:"<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/" target="_blank">Gutenberg 1.0.0</a> was released this week as another iteration in the beta period that will continue on with 1.1 next week. Design lead Tammie Lister said the team decided &#8220;not let numbers set expectations&#8221; and will carry on at the same pace with weekly releases.</p>\n<p>One of the most visible UI updates in version 1.0 is the new ability to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2447" target="_blank">add image blocks by dragging and dropping them into the editor</a>. They can be placed directly within the content (between blocks) and also onto the image block placeholder. Gutenberg includes a blue line indicator for dropzones where users can place an image.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gutenberg-image-upload.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After testing I found this feature works smoothly but is a little slow. The slight delay of uploading the image after placing it may leave the user confused about what is happening. However, feedback on this particular pull request indicates that the team is working on displaying an immediate reaction to the image having been dropped, instead of waiting for the upload to finish.</p>\n<p>This release also <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2452" target="_blank">merges the paragraph and cover text blocks</a>.

I don’t know how this number &#8217;33&#8217; sounds to you, but in some ways, I feel it’s a big number. I know many of you would argue that 33 is not an age to be considered old. In this article I will share about my career with <strong>WordPress</strong> lasting over 13 years, and how I am planning to retire within a year, more or less. And if you are an <strong>Entrepreneur</strong> yourself or self-established person, I think this will be an intriguing discussion, I will add some key pointers from my life that lead me to this decision.</span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/edit_IMG_1358.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2067 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/edit_IMG_1358-1024x819.jpg" alt="Me Enjoying the Sun & Jetpack Tees after a long drive to Key West!" width="960" height="768" /></a>Me Enjoying the Sun &amp; Jetpack Tees after a long drive to Key West, FL!\n<h3><b>What do I mean by &#8216;retire&#8217;?</b></h3>\n<p><span>So, may be you are shocked to just see the title. The word ‘retire’ could be little confusing. Does that mean I am going to take leave from all of my ventures permanently? Will not be involved with anything day to day basis. And will be walking out in my beach-shorts in broad daylight, or vacationing endlessly anywhere in the world? </span></p>\n<p><span>In some sense, Yes, in some sense, No. The kind of office I have I could literally go in shorts though, and my life has given me the opportunity to vacation as I want, almost!</span></p>\n<p><span>But, yes, I am talking about taking leave from most of my ventures, at least not being involved day to day. And kind of taking a break to reflect more into life. I have been working tirelessly for a decade. I need some kind of breathing space, it&#8217;s not exactly what you think though. It’s kind of reboot. I will keep expanding the idea throughout the article. If you are really into, sadly you have to keep reading.</span></p>\n<h2><b>So, who am I?</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am not sure how boring this might get, but still, let me introduce myself.

As this article is entirely about me, you have to tolerate a lot more. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" /></span></p>\n<p><strong>This is going to be the biggest ever article published in HeroPress!</strong></p>\n<h2><b>So, I always wanted to do WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>No, obviously not. In my childhood I always wanted to be <strong>a scientist, a Physicist</strong> to be exact. And it&#8217;s not just like an aim-in-life, I was literally very serious. I was always into Space Science. Later it grew more into Physics. To give you an idea how serious I was, let me tell you something. While going through some old boxes, I found out some paper-cutting from back in 1993(I was in 3rd Grade back then), about coverage of different space exploration, news about Pioneer, upcoming plan on a Probe in Saturn. I literally had a file to collect those. Back in that day, that&#8217;s what you could do most, without any internet, and from a remote part of <strong>Bangladesh</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>I was not extremely good in school, it&#8217;s not like what you read in the story, never stood 2nd type(always 1st)! It&#8217;s more like I never stood 1st type! But I was good in math, I was always progressing, and the main blessing I had in my life was support of my parents, unlikely most parents in our time, they never pushed me into things, never tried to push their judgment into my life. When I advanced from one Class to another, making some progress, they were happy with it, and I always made progress. So, they were happy, I was happy being a mediocre-student. But the issue was, in my mind, I was the best. I know how childish it sounds, but I was really a child back then! I always thought that I am best if I try enough, and if I was given enough opportunity. So, Instead of trying to do best in the Class, I focused on many things, like starting a Detective Company to Secret R&amp;D Team, and none of those was a joke, we were serious. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Reading!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I always loved reading, and I was extremely lucky to have so much opportunity to read in my childhood. My house has some collection of children’s book, some cheap but interesting translation, my parents always brought me books on every possible occasion, as that&#8217;s what would make me happy. When that was not enough, I practically sneaked into most houses in the neighborhood. I was in 7th Grade at that time, and if a neighbor had an older kid they would have more books, and good part was if you show interest in reading books, and return it carefully, they would not mind to open up their bookshelf door for you, and most of them even loved me for this. Later on, I also finished up most of my relatives collection in the same town. Later on when in high-school everyone around knew I love books. Later on, this grew on my friends as well. I was lucky to have good childhood friends, who also enjoyed books as well. So, we would gift books to each others birthday, so we could read it ourselves. And few of my friend was very good students, and they always got some scholarship money, so we spend everything in our school life on books!</span></p>\n<p><b>So, what was I was reading? Everything!</b></p>\n<p><b> &#8211; Everything!</b></p>\n<p><span>Starting from Children’s story later grew into Detective Story, Science Fiction, and later into the adventure story, literature, whatever comes into my hand. One interesting thing I also did from the very early stage, keeps track on what I am reading. It probably came from my hobby of collecting Stamps. We used to make notes and categorize our collection. So, I started doing the same for Books. I made a notebook, started noting and making a list of what I am reading, later on, I started to make some remarks, note, what I liked, what not. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Writing!</b></h2>\n<p><span>In my teenage life writing took even more meaning. I was always good at expressing myself, and creative writing. But when one of our best friends left the country, and the only way to communicate was to write letters, so, we started to do that. It took different turn very soon. We were enjoying writing letters so much, few of us in the same class who we see every day also started writing letters to each other. However, it was nothing like a love letter or anything related to the affair, we were writing about anything, everything. At one point we were in a competition who could write the longest letter. In this competition, one of my friends wrote a letter to me (again from the same class, sitting almost on my next desk! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" /> ) over 50 pages, and to defeat her I wrote an over <strong>100-page long letter</strong>! </span></p>\n<p><span>*If you are wondering what I wrote in those 100 pages &#8211; I have a very large family, where my relatives of great-great-grandfather’s cousin’s and their family are still very connected and if you saw me talking with any of them you would think they are my 1st Uncle or Aunt. So, what I did is wrote about my whole family tree, describing family history and later on describing each and every member I could remember! In my house we had a very old “Family Birth Register” (জন্ম কষ্টি খাতা), dating back in the early 1900s, I even took help from it!</span></p>\n<p>Over all this had a different impact on our life. I don&#8217;t know how hard it is to believe, but I was into Bangla Literature, specially poem as well, I even had a notebook full with my own poem! One of our classmates even wrote a full-blown 150+ pages novel in that age! And I am still enjoying writing!</p>\n<p><b>Dramatic changes in my Educational life!</b></p>\n<p><span>As described earlier, </span><span>I was average in studies</span><span> but not extremely good. And I was happy about it! All my </span><span>close friends were very good students and would achieve the first or second position in class every time. Whereas, I was happy being in the 8th or 10th position. But as said in my mind I was the best!</span></p>\n<p><span>Our educational system requires you to memorize and write as it is. But I was driven into reading books, and other things (also including playing Cricket seriously). I never tried to focus on memorizing anything. And from childhood, teachers grow an impression of what to expect from a particular student. So, for an example, my social science teacher knew for years what to expect from me, and it&#8217;s very hard to get past that impression. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was advancing from Grade 8 to 9, I took part in a Scholarship exam. </span><span>We prepared for a year. Only a handful of us was participating from our school, I was among those few, but I had literally zero chance to get the scholarship. I was not very bothered about it at all. But during the exam, we had to travel to another town to the exam, and it was in the month of Ramadan, and I did not break my fast. It was hard, I had 2 exams in a single day. When I came back home one day with my father, my mom was sad seeing me so tired and drained out. But was happy that I was still fasting. Then she told me something very simply, which started a chain-reaction in my life. She told me, &#8220;You think of yourself so highly, you spend all of your time with those same kids, who are doing so good in school. But if you really think of yourself so highly, why not try to reflect that in your grade?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Maybe it&#8217;s very normal for parents to talk like that. But as my parents never compared me with anybody or always let me do in my way, I kept on thinking about this. </span><span>What clicked in my mind was that, i</span><span>f I am really good, I should be able to do good in any circumstances, if this requires me to memorize everything I could do that. If I want to be really that good, and be a good scientist, I need to learn to cope up and fight in any situation. </span></p>\n<p><b>So, I changed myself, was even memorizing books, that I absolutely did not like!</b></p>\n<p><span>In grade 9 &amp; 10, I studied very hard. I changed my lifestyle a lot. I changed the way I write in exam paper to change the impression of my teacher. Before I was always like studying in my mind, not writing what I just read, I forced myself in writing those answer I just read, it was very hard and boring at the beginning. But I had a very good private tutor, who guided me in every way. Later on my teachers in school helped in every way possible. In Bangladesh student have to take a part in a Certification Exam after 10th Grade, to advance in College, its called SSC, Secondary School Certificate Exam. I prepared for that. At the end of 10th Grade, I almost had the book fully memorized, I could write as it is, correct to each and every comma and space. I improved my english a lot. I learned some calculous which was not part of our curriculum, just to advance myself for college, and I knew if I had to do better in Physics I need to learn math and Calculous better. I did took part in more Prep test than most other students. And ultimately in the School Preparation Exam, I did extremely well to boost up my energy!</span></p>\n<p><span>Everything was perfect, we took part in the big exam!</span></p>\n<p><b>And I did not get the grade I expected!</b></p>\n<p><span>Interestingly our batch did not get good grades in SSC</span><span>, we were the first batch in a new grading system, and we did not know that even before the exam, so none got perfect grade of 5.0, I got a very average grade(not bad, but not very good either). I was extremely disappointed, broken, but later learned to cope up.</span><span> I realized a good lesson of life that </span><b>&#8211; Even though you may work hard and go to great lengths to do everything possible, still you might have to deal with failures and disappointments.</b></p>\n<p><span>Another good thing also happened in my life too. I moved from the small town I grew up, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishwardi_Upazila">Ishurdi</a></strong>, to the Capitol of the Nation, <strong>Dhaka</strong>, and was able to get a chance in the entrance exam, of all big colleges in the country where I tried. This gave me a huge boost in confidence. I selected to study in <strong>Notre Dame College</strong>, in English Medium of Science. It was another controversial decision I made, for me a kid coming from rather a small town, and from Bangla Medium it was a tough decision, but I stick to it for the future, because I still wanted to be a Physicist, wanted to study further in my life, I knew I had to be in English Medium.</span></p>\n<p><b>I had very hard time at the beginning of College!</b></p>\n<p><span>At the start it was very hard, our whole group suffered a lot to cope up with new curriculum, our first semester in College was the worst. But later we learned to cope up, we were 130 students in our Group (famous Group 8 in Notre Dame College), we all were helpful to each other, not everyone had private teacher in this point, we shared our notes, I was living first time without my parents, I was also dealing with occasional sickness due to not eating properly. So, there was a lot of struggle, but by the end of 1st year, I was dealing with everything properly. I got a good friend circle, I was not only doing well in college, I was also enjoying my freedom and mostly dealing with anything life throws at me!</span></p>\n<h2><b>My Introduction to Computer &amp; Programming!</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, I always loved programming, before entering University I already knew some basic programming, like qBasic, FORTRAN, even some level of Pascal. The kind of society I grew up, a computer was extremely rare before the year 2000. I was kind of lucky to be able to learn basic computer usage starting from the year 1998, got my first computer in 1999. It was so rare to own a computer in that time for that part of the word, that I was not only the first kid in my class to own a computer, but only a handful of people in my town knew how to use a computer. So, though I am not from a very rich or privileged family, extremely lucky that my parents understood the importance in that time. </span></p>\n<p><span>Another interesting aspect was unlike most people, I was not fully taken over by Computer Games. I am not saying gaming is bad, but most of the people I later see own a computer, the main thing they do with it was playing the game all the time. And you have to understand that almost pre-internet period in Bangladesh. I use the internet first in my life back in 2001. I was more into tweaking things, trying to create or modify the software or create very basic type tools. I am super amazed by internet from first interaction. The search engine was in its peak time, discovering new resource was easy. I tried creating my first webpage in Yahoo Geocities back in 2001, wap page generator was also taking shape in coming years. </span></p>\n<p><b>Say Hi to WordPress in my life!</b></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2068 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1-1024x863.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="809" /></a>M Asif Rahman &#8211; Wearing Tees by WordPressian Group!\n<p><span>      I created my first blog back in 2003 in Blogger, but while trying to add a sidebar and customizing home page look, I find it&#8217;s very difficult for me to do anything in ASP.net, then I found WordPress, back in the year 2004. I still remember reading Matt’s blog and write up about how the whole project is moving ahead from b2 cafelog. WordPress was so easy, I hardly knew any PHP in that time, but my HTML and CSS knowledge was well enough for me being able to edit my personal blog. At the start hosting was one issue, but again I was lucky to manage one. Later when WordPress.com came, I migrated my blog over there and was happy at the beginning, as less hassle. I was also heavily involved with forum community. There was some very large community for webmaster and developer, I loved PHPbb and other solution for forums as well. But after experiencing some massive vulnerabilities, which lead to a major data breach, I focused more on personal blogging and soon into web development. Wth WordPress it was extremely easy to create a website, plugin and theming turn out to be not a complex task. The community and developers contributing in this ecosystem were another main factors. I feel very connected with the whole ecosystem, eventually became habituated with this, and started to feel it&#8217;s my comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><b>How I started my career and company!</b></p>\n<p><span>I was using the name A. R. Communication, an as an acronym of my initials (Asif Rahman) back in 2001 as well, but it was nothing serious, no particular business. When in college, to support myself I first started a Marketing Trainee job in a Multi-international company. It was convenient with my college time and location, and they were literally paying to learn things. I started it just the as need of money, but later I enjoyed marketing, corporate training, and even enjoyed sales training as well. But I never took that job a as career choice.</span></p>\n<h3><b>My first venture!</b></h3>\n<p><span>In the year 2003, before even going to Universities I started a full 4 color magazine, printed publication with a close friend of mine. It was a fun ride. The name of the magazine was “</span><b>Fortnightly Tumi</b><span>”, the Bangla word “Tumi” means “</span><b>You</b><span>”! It was a lifestyle Magazine. My family already had a history with the printing business, so I had some experience. We did this business very thoroughly if you consider this as our first venture. We did a proper market study, interviewed potential readers, organized group discussion, and got good funding. And we also started with bang! Hired renowned journalist and writer. I was barely <strong>19 years old</strong> that time, have very experienced people in my team over 50 years old, and managing them was good lesson. All together we published 3 edition, with good marketing trick we were able to sell 10,000 copy nationwide for that last edition, we had over 20 big brands in the country advertising with us. But still, that business did not work out. We had to shut down, as our investor (my friend’s family) want us to focus on our education instead of this, and we were probably way ahead of our time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Too many choices after college!</b></p>\n<p><span>I did fairly good in college, despite being in English medium. I applied for the various scholarship in different university all around the world, and was in a process of ISSB for Airforce as GD Pilot, the whole process was lengthy, and I was only doing it for 2 reasons.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>One of my friends asked me to collect the form, as it was close from my house, and I thought why not fill up together.</span></li>\n<li><span>GD Pilots also get the chance of studying Aeronautical Engineering and even switch to Engineering in future, and they will have a chance to study higher in that subject, which could open up my door for getting into Space Science. All for free, paid by Govt.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Interestingly I get past all the test and selected finally. But they informed me, I have to stay in GD Pilot as a cadet and will be commissioned in 2 years, but have to think Pilot as a career, I was confused, I never enjoyed or felt the passion for speed before in my life. And we had few months time before joining the Force.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the meantime, I got so many opportunities in various universities. And one of my dream to study further in Physics was too close, as I got a chance in Uni Penn, and got a scholarship there as well. I had few other opportunities at Canada and Australia. I even applied for Visa for Australia as well, but later had to decide against all of those for some family and personal reason. </span></p>\n<p><span>I ultimately left Air Force as well, me &amp; my parents agree that&#8217;sts not a good career choice for me, given the option I had. I got a scholarship at North South University in Electrical &amp; Telecommunications Engineering. And as I started my company seriously at beginning of 2004, then a University that offers Open Credit, where I am able to choose my workload, it was just convenient. So, out of all promising option, I almost chose the risky one, to make my own company and study in Bangladesh, at least for the Bachelor.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The inception of ARCom:</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, ARCom is the short version of A. R. Communications. As I found making website too easy with WordPress, and a new found talent was helping me as well. </span></p>\n<p><span>Just as I never waste time on gaming, rather enjoyed my time to tweak things, creating new application. Instead of most people, when they visit a new website, they look at the shiny look, or how good or better information it provides, whenever I visit a good site, I was always thinking how they are making money, how is this built and sustained. This quest has helped me making our first successful business. It took years, it did not turn into something very big in a night. During University years I did make many different kinds of websites, in that time I started earning first from selling websites. That was during the year 2005 or 2006, it was long before Sitepoint turn into Flippa, back in the shining days of DigitalPoint! I used that money to buy more domain. I hired my university classmate to work with me. The first outsider I hired in my company was a designer, as I needed help in there. Later it kept growing over the year.</span></p>\n<h3><b>First Big Success:</b></h3>\n<p><span>Though I already enjoyed some good (if not very big) payday by selling a website, point to note here, I was selling website as a business, not like you design a site and sell, its more about creating a business, create a process and sell it for a 2X &#8211; 5X yearly profit. But my big success came after 2008. Everything was turning so well, I was done with my University. My company was already a Team of over 20 people, with an office of 2500 square feet space. We started </span><a href="https://thetechjournal.com"><b>The Tech Journal</b></a><span>, it worked so well in every aspect. As I was into writing blogs and also into the gadget. After the first iPhone release I was involved in many ways, from working with the secret group who were Jailbreaking each and every firmware, also new kind of responsive websites, I was also into News &amp; those kinds of stuff. And because of my quest to understand how a thing works, I had a good grasp already into Content Distribution. Facebook and other Social Media are playing a role in content and distribution already. It all helped.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Tech Journal became very big!</b></p>\n<p><span>Within 6 months of start, we ranked within top 20k website. I was enjoying the ride to play with monetization and taking things into next phase. At one pick point, we were ranked even within top 4000 websites in Alexa. I had a good team with me. I finished my university already, 3 of my University friend was working with me full time. We all shared same vision for The Tech Journal, and it kept on growing. Because of our experience with WordPress we kept on innovating, for us we could build anything in WordPress, I had a solid Development team as well.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Marriage &amp; Beyond!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I got married at 2009, I was 25 years old back then. I don’t know if there is any perfect age for marriage, but I felt that was the right time, I was doing good in business, was looking for more stability in emotional life as well. I suddenly found my long lost childhood friend, <strong>Bipasha</strong>, whom I did not have any communication for past 13 years, but suddenly fall in love and we decide to get married. <strong>Just like that!</strong> I will not go into details here(it&#8217;s already too big) how we studied together since 1st grade and got detached when we were in 7th Grade, but still got married 13 years later. We started a new life, life was never better!</span></p>\n<p><b>Moving Further with WordPress:</b></p>\n<p><span>Over the year WordPress kept growing so was I. I was writing, blogging, building things with WordPress. WordCamp was already something, but I was not able to attend or participate as I was still in Universities, but after finishing up, I decide to get more involved. I spoke in my first WordCamp in WordCamp Melbourne. For many years I was also very vocal about security and optimization, so I started to get so many opportunities into speaking and participating in various things. I still remember I spent one crazy summer in the US, participating 6 WordCamps, visiting 9 States and 13 cities in the process, starting from Boston and finishing at San Francisco! </span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2069" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1-1024x514.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="482" /></a>WordCamp SF 2014 &#8211; Mission Bay Conference Center\n<p><span>I was very lucky to be able to speak at last ever WordCamp San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pursuing more into Investment!</b></p>\n<p><span>It&#8217;s mainly because of <strong>The Tech Journal</strong>, I was involved in many tech conferences, and always getting the pitch from various startups. And my new grown circle of friends from WordPress and various other tech scenes, I already established a good connection in Silicon Valley. It was in the year 2009 when I made my first Angel investment, the credit must go to my friend circle, it was years before Angel List, there was offline syndicate where folks will share investment opportunity. But I really loved talking with young entrepreneur and seeing how new business works. I kept my focus in my sector, the field I understand. So, I mainly invested in tech. Out of several investments, one of my lucky ones was Facebook, I was able to invest in <strong>Facebook</strong> before their IPO, not very early, but still Pre-IPO stage, it was one of my lucky breaks. As I was already doing good in my business I tried to utilize it. I did not start investing because I had too much cash laying around, I started because I liked those opportunities, I wanted to help those ideas or startups.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Moving into the US:</b></h2>\n<p><span>I started another business in US, where my partner was from Orlando, I spent one Thanksgiving with my Wife in Orlando, really loved the place, people, and we already got a long term Visa, and had full opportunity to live anywhere we want. My company in Bangladesh was already in a stable phase, and as I was traveling heavily for years, my team was used to being managed remotely, so it was not a hard decision. But staying far from parents was hard. So, what we started maintaining both houses in Bangladesh and Florida. For years we spend some part of the year in US, rest in Bangladesh. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Child &amp; Changes in Life!</b></h3>\n<p><span>Like everybody else our life was bound to change when we had baby. In year 2014 we were getting for our first baby. We decide to stay in US, because of better medical facility and my involvement in different things. Just a month after speaking at WordCamp San Francisco in November we were blessed with <strong>Aaniyah</strong>. Actually, our life already changed when we were planning and waiting for the baby. I was feeling the work routine I have would never let me spend the time I want to have with my baby.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2070" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh-1024x691.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="648" /></a></p>\n<h2><b>Analytify &amp; A New friendship!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I became friends with </span><a href="http://www.adnan.pk/"><span>Muhammad Adnan</span></a><span> online back in 2014, he was working with his premium Plugin <a href="https://analytify.io/"><strong>Analytify</strong></a> back then. I found this as a real good project and started talking with him, giving him various advice, and we later decided to team up, and we released the first free version of Analytify WordPress plugin on 1st January 2015. It was a success, it completely revolutionizes how people use Google Analytics in WordPress. Later Adnan visited me in the US in 2015, and together we attended WordCamp Miami and had a good trip and drive to Key West! The most interesting part of the friendship lies somewhere else. I am a Bangladeshi, and Adnan is Pakistani. Both of our nation has a very bad past. Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan, back in 1971 we fought for about 9 months, and millions of people died in the process before we got Freedom and Declared Independence from Pakistan. But it creates a life long enmity between two countries. I know for an outsider it does not make sense to keep some feelings for that long, but for its very personal for us. Our country lost so much in that war, even if you speak about just my family, My Grandmother lost half of her family in that war, Bangladeshi especially have a very strong opinion about any Pakistani. But meeting Adnan, becoming friends, and working together made me realize few interesting thing, this feeling, this agony against any Pakistani was one-way. Most of the Pakistani did not have any idea what their Government or Army did, they hardly have idea about their Ancestors’ doing. They rather still consider us Brother! Some of the history he never knew, they never read in their history book. I would never know this if it&#8217;s not for </span><b>WordPress</b><span>, we would never meet, this change in understanding for both of us never happened.</span></p>\n<p><span>And we together kept on growing <strong>Analytify</strong>, as the best Google Analytics Plugin in WordPress, and planning many interesting things together.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Coming Back to Bangladesh!</b></h2>\n<p><span>While I was staying and mostly investing in the US, I started investing in some interesting Teams in Bangladesh from the year 2012. Over the year, a few failed, but some really kept on growing. In the year 2016, in Pre-Trump period we were expecting our 2nd Baby, and it was too hard for us to manage alone in the US, and we both were missing our family. I want my kids to grow up having their family close to them, the way I grew up. I want my parents to feel close to them. Occasionally when we visited Bangladesh with our first child, I was quite blown away the way they loved and took care of the baby. It all made sense if we spend some more time in Bangladesh, and have the Baby in here. And the weird things going on with the US also motivated my decision. The kind of craziness we are seeing in the US, actually did not start just by having Trump elected. It goes way back. We were living in a  very peaceful neighborhood in Florida, a small town called Orange City, near Daytona Beach! But we could still feel the change in air. Our parents have a pending Immigration Application for near a decade, they are on the que to become US citizen anyway. We first tried to have them with us, but US Embassy in Bangladesh rejected that application, for absolutely no reason. And my other venture was already growing in Bangladesh. So, all together we decide to stay in Bangladesh for awhile, we moved in mid-2016.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Welcoming Aadiyah into the Family!</b></h3>\n<p><span>We had our 2nd Baby <strong>Aadiyah</strong> in September 2016, a bit ahead of time, my wife got little too sick, but we were able to handle everything because of having family together. We moved into a large Duplex house, to have enough space for the baby. We feel we are complete as family and never been this happy before.</span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2071" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a>Complete Family!\n<h1><b>weDevs &amp; My Legacy!</b></h1>\n<p><span>I will discuss later my involvement in Bangladeshi WordPress Eco-system. But back in 2013 I first met <a href="https://tareq.co/">Tareq</a>, a very talented Bangladeshi Programmer, running a successful WordPress product company. He and his Partner <strong>Nizam</strong> built an amazing company, and they had few very interesting and super successful products for WordPress. I started helping as possible from my end, I want them to succeed and pushing them to move forward. I became an official partner and board member of <a href="https://wedevs.com"><strong>weDevs</strong></a> back in 2015. I was helping them to grow internationally and advising them as part of the board. We established a US company and kept on growing. Though I was in WordPress for very long time, my main company <strong>ARCom</strong> was never serious into WordPress Product. I released some of <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/asif2bd">our work</a> in Open Source via WordPress.org Plugin Directory, and with my growing experience with <strong>Analytify</strong> made me dig more into WordPress products.</span></p>\n<p><span>Somehow at the end of 2016, <strong>Tareq</strong> and I was looking at our numbers for <strong>weDevs</strong> in 2016, we noticed something very important. Three of us spend more time digging deep into the numbers and re-analyzed our process and priorities. Soon we all came into understanding we have to take things forward with <strong>weDevs</strong>, the growth of the industry is very important if we want to be big in future this is the right time. They proposed to me if I could take over as <strong>CEO</strong>. Nizam was running weDevs successfully as CEO for years, and I never thought seriously about running another company, and my retirement plan was already in place. But we found this could be the best thing we could do in the year 2017, where I have little over 1.5 years before my planned retirement. </span></p>\n<p><span>So, I jumped into the ship. I always dreamed to make a rocking and successful company in WordPress product space, and it was my chance. And as it&#8217;s already a running successful company, my goal here to build a legacy, instead of just making a profitable company, built a sustainable company, and proper team, a fine management, that could grow into future, that could </span><b>outgrow us</b><span>, something even bigger than us combined. </span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2073 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a>weDevs new office &#8211; Reception Area from inside &#8211; WordPress Flavoured!\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>So, I took over <strong>weDevs of CEO</strong> in January 2017, I took 2 months as the transition period and blend fully into the day to day system. We announced this officially in the month of March. Dhaka is a very jam packed city with the highest number of people living in per square miles in the world. We were already a Team of about 25 people. I still had few other business that I have to take care. So, we moved to a new large space. A total of 5000 square feet space, fully open, we built a unique office that could sustain us for next few year. I moved my house and office in the same area, called <strong>Mirpur DOHS</strong>. Me, my partners, and almost 12 of us together moved into this area together. As we now live within 2 min distance from the office, the Traffic could not bother us at all. We gave the option for our employees to move into too. We paid the moving cost, we even adjusted salary if they faced any increase of cost for housing or anything. We took time, but now our new office is complete, it&#8217;s one very interesting WordPress themed workplace.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2074" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We are growing further, our team of 25 people will soon <strong>become a team of  50+</strong>. We are working on new stunning products, we just launched a brand new super fast Form Builder plugin named <a href="https://wedevs.com/weforms/"><strong>weForms</strong></a>. It will revolutionize the way people build forms and create anything from just a simple contact form to organize a quiz. Our team built it entirely on Vue.JS, as a single page app. It&#8217;s unbelievably fast, almost nothing we have seen so far inside WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our Team internally working very hard to update our existing product and we are working on some new things that I am incredibly looking forward to. Before I join, weDevs did not have a marketing team, we ran entirely autonomous. In last 6 months, we have built a sustainable Content &amp; Marketing Team. I am working tirelessly with my CTO &amp; COO to build a new culture. We have a two-way feedback evaluation process. I created a kind of unique in its way, a grading system where the company could give feedback to an employee, on exact point, and inform directly where they need to improve. It&#8217;s a kind of algorithm I have developed over the years and really helps you to make a happy and working team. In the same way, Employee also have the opportunity to give feedback to the company directly &#8211; about what makes them happy, how a company could help him grow more, or if the company is addressing every concern properly. We do this quarterly basis, and review in each quarter, so the improvement could always be tracked, graphed and addressed properly.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Bangladeshi WordPress Community!</b></h2>\n<p><span>This is another very proud thing I would like to talk about. When I first had a very detail conversation with Matt Mullenweg, back in 2011, he was very happy that I attending so many WordCamp, and be that much involved with the community, he asked me about WP community back my country, and told me if we are able to have a good group, a nice meetup and eventually a WordCamp, he will try to attend. I found a new role for myself, over the year we grew Bangladeshi WordPress community. Locally we have very growing and engaging WordPress Group, called WordPressians, we have over 21,000 Members in Facebook. We are a team of 15 Admin/Organizer who maintains everything, and it&#8217;s an open group so always evolving. Over the year, we 15 became very close to each other, and we all consider each other as best friend. We contribute in Open Source together, we hangout together, attend various WordCamps around together now, we plan day out together as well. This is another blessing happened to our life mainly because of WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2075" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881-1024x417.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="391" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Starting from 2013 we are official meetup chapter in Dhaka. We organized over 15 meetup, where each and every meetup of our could be considered little WordCamp, with 4-6 session, and had 150-300 attendees. We organized all of our meetup in our own platform, a WordPress plugin we created, so everything happened at &#8211; WPressians.net, not at Meetup.com, we did it with direct permission from WordPress Foundation. We have made WordCamp Application starting from 2013. And I even faced Organizer interview twice in 2014.</span></p>\n<h3><b>But the sadness!</b></h3>\n<p><span>There is one thing that hurt me a lot. Though me and our organizing team worked so hard to grow Bangladeshi WordPress community, but due to some miscommunication, we still don&#8217;t have any WordCamp yet. The foundation failed to take timely measures to proceed with our WordCamp application, we faced repeated issues in getting the proper timely response from them. Out of frustration and years of waiting back in 2015, we organized a CMS Conference in Dhaka, where we had over 10 speakers, and there were over 1500 attendees. So our team has proven their position, but things took so long from the Foundation. I wrote to foundation much time, there is one on-going conversation, still, we hope for the best, this the way Foundation handled our communication, shows the lack-of-attention clearly. I am almost devastated in this and very hurt! When I first attended and spoke in WordCamp Melbourne in 2011, I was the first Bangladeshi to ever do so. I but I kept on pushing. Now there is over 10 from even just our organizing team where they attended in various <strong>WordCamps around the World</strong>. Last year we attended WordCamp Singapore with a team of 9 people from Bangladesh. We are gaining experience, we are driven, but still lacking behind because of Foundation, sadly! I attended over <strong>50 WordCamps</strong> worldwide, I helped to organize over 10 WordCamps in various cities, but could not organize a single one in my home country for 6 years, this keeps bugging me all the time!</span></p>\n<h1><b>My Future Plan!</b></h1>\n<h2><b>Plan to retire by my next Birthday!</b></h2>\n<h3><b>weDevs to keep on Growing!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I am here at weDevs to create and fine tune the process and build the vision. I already described what&#8217;s happening in there. From my start as CEO we are seeing about 15% month to month growth in revenue and about 20% in market reach, We will keep on doing so and beyond. And we will probably get more result in long term, and building team, forming up a new culture and getting result certainly take more than 6 months.</span></p>\n<p><span>So far the plan is to me stay in Day to Day involve up until June 2018. This is not an exact day plan, could change with time. But possibly by September!</span></p>\n<h2><b>ARCom being Autonomous!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am running ARCom without much of daily maintenance for awhile now. I have Team Lead, Editors, Managers in place, that&#8217;s running their wing successfully for awhile now. There are few new plans and things my Team working, but all team has a lead, which they ran with ownership, and mostly sustainable. There are some places where we need some work, I hope it will be done by that projected time.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Geeky Social, 3rdBell and my other venture!</b></h2>\n<p><b>Geeky Social</b><span> has a solid team, and they are running amazingly. I am very proud of our team. I am part of the board and now serving as Chairman, and probably will continue to do so. I hope by next 6-9 months we will be even stronger financially, our month to month growth is already steady and growing, we are clear it will grow a lot from there. One of our core success is to grow beyond a cash-hungry business, which is incredibly hard if you are involved in Digital Media, and buying. But we got past that and now everything taking shape. I am very confident in the team and looking forward.</span></p>\n<p><a href="https://3rdbell.co"><b>3rdBell</b></a><span> faced so much issues over the year, but now we have a solid platform, the founders are incredibly motivated. Me and other investors are looking forward. I am still involved as Technical Director, this role could extend for the time being when we go through some changes, but we have solid plan to move forward, and by mid-next year, it should be i a  different height.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Me &amp; WordPress &#8211; going forward! </b></h2>\n<p><span>I will have people to maintain my plugin, and provide even better support, and few of them are even joining next month, so it will be well taken care of. I will shift the community role mostly to new people and others. Next 9 months I will dedicate to have more Contributor from my community and circle. I will literally incubate contributor,  from Core contribution to Docs and Community team. I will drive more into sharing my experience and finding over the decade. Besides writing, which I think is my superpower(!), but still under used, I will drive more into Speaking. Those are my next upcoming  Session, if you are happened to any of those WordCamp, please say Hi!</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>WordCamp Colombo, Sri Lanka &#8211; 23rd September</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b><a href="https://2017.colombo.wordcamp.org/speaker/m-asif-rahman/"><span> Making Million in WordPress Plugin But Not Being Evil!</span></a></p>\n<p><span>      2)  <strong>WordCamp Ahmedabad, India &#8211; 7th October</strong></span></p>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b> <a href="https://2017.ahmedabad.wordcamp.org/"><span>You heard content is the king, but are you paying attention to Content Distribution?</span></a></p>\n<p><span>If you read so far, you should understand how relevant both topic to my life! </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>How could I financially sustain this?</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am thinking, planning and working on this retirement plan for awhile now. The main question I got asked how could I financially sustain. I don’t know what kind of impression you have got so far by reading about my life. Yes, I own several successful ventures, running a very growing and profitable business, I also invested in the 20+ venture and was extremely lucky to enjoy some exit from the investment. But not in very big scale. Some of my investment looks promising, but that does not make me very rich in cash. So this plan further is not about having tons of cash in hand laying around, it&#8217;s more about having sustainable and ongoing earning. I do certainly have some exit I am looking forward to but my plan will not depend on it. I am confident now I could easily go beyond this month-to-month type calculation! </span></p>\n<h2><b>The Hardest Part!</b></h2>\n<p><span>When you grow business for over a decade, the main challenges are people. Like some successful venture, I also have businesses that are not cash-positive but has people involved with it for years. When you run a business, you become responsible for those people, their family depends on your decision, that type of responsibilities will limit you sometimes taking logical business decision. And really relying so much into people, and the fear of let going control could be hard dilemma any Entrepreneur could feel. </span></p>\n<p><span>But over the year I learned,<strong> sometimes you have to let go to get things done for future, sometimes you have to take a leap of faith</strong>. So, I practiced that for some time now. I am positive that things will work out, and won&#8217;t break apart.</span></p>\n<h1><b>Reason: Why I am doing this?</b></h1>\n<p><span>In some ways I feel I am doing this for very long time. I have built team, product, faced hard time, and also enjoyed when things work out, I have gone through this circle so many times. There is always hard time and I have seen how it all ultimately always worked out. I kind of want to get out of this circle. Sometimes I feel tired. Though for a person like me who single handily started everything, broke so many barriers, it&#8217;s hard to get me tensed. I know how to deal with pressure, hard time, shitty situation. In some ways I am resistant to those. But when I reflect everything in my life I am very proud what I have done, what I have Achieved.</span></p>\n<p><b>Monetary wealth did not make me rich! </b><span>But the experience and relation that I cultivated did. I feel rich because of this. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was still a teenager, dreaming to be a physicist, I had a very thorough vision of my future, I wanted to finish my PhD by age 25. Later in the course of life I became Entrepreneur. Then my goal was to become a millionaire  by age 25 and have a stable family. I was successful in that. I have the vision to built amazing WordPress team and product, I am doing that right now. </span></p>\n<p><b>I want to move on, I would like to see greater meaning of life. </b><span>That does not mean what I am doing is great, it&#8217;s just going beyond. I always thought life has a bigger meaning for me, I always felt privileged, the kind of life I had, most people from my demography could not have, so I have bigger responsibilities! </span></p>\n<h2><b>How &#8216;Big&#8217; is WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>WordPress is biggest CMS and No.1 solution to make Website, but how many businesses do you see worth over a $100M in WordPress Ecosystem? Or over $50M? Not much. And because of so much recent #WPDrama, one thing is very clear, we have a long way to grow. I kind of feel to make it too big, we even limited ourself as well. I do see the power struggle inside the community as well. The most respected person in the community, now have very large number of haters, and for few semi-valid reasons.<strong> That is sad, maybe we all need to rethink!</strong></span></p>\n<h1><b>What will I do in future?</b></h1>\n<p>Maybe I will <strong>drive deep into science</strong>, I will be still 34, even enough time to study something new! <span>Maybe I will just enjoy the break for awhile. Maybe I will try to find the better meaning of life. Or maybe will write a book, I don’t know, I want to keep the option open, have an open heart. I do certainly earn this freedom myself, I am very grateful to the list of endless great people that helped me throughout the decade of my career.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Your kids to reflect You!</b></h2>\n<p><span>We all want our kids to be like us, we want them to reflect us in a good way, and go beyond. But If we are not involved in every process of their life how could this happen? If you let your family, mainly wife to entirely take care of your kid how they are going to learn from you? Do you really believe just giving 1-2 hours a day will do the trick? It&#8217;s way more than that. I want to be an integral part of my kids’ life. I want to be fully involved in their process of growing up. In this whole thing, there is nothing related of deciding fate of their life. I have no expectation of making my kids something, I am fully open, they will decide their destiny, their own venture. I just want to help them understand this World, </span><b>be their Dad</b><span>, be the friend they could play with, be the teacher they need, as long as they need.</span></p>\n<p><span>I will spend more time with my family, my 2 young daughters really need more of me, they will be 4 &amp; 2 by next year. They will go into school, perfect time for me to jump in.</span></p>\n<h1><strong>Conclusion: For You!</strong></h1>\n<p>If you came this far reading this, you could probably tell I enjoyed writing! My routine hardly gives me more option to do it regularly. I was meant to write this HeroPress article last year but was too busy, and the timing was too near of the 2nd baby&#8217;s birth!</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect others to try to retire early, but having a choice in life is important. Try to look back. Why do you work? Is it because of earning money? Just to survive, just to sustain your family? This should not be the purpose of human life. I believe our Creator created us for a reason, <strong>we are not meant to live and die selfishly like an animal. There should be more meaning of life other than trying to buy luxury!</strong></p>\n<p>There is a Ted talk describing Humans, how evaluated to be Human, one of the core reason was we cooked, and gathered and stored food, so we spent less time like other Gorillas to try to find food and spend most of the days for that purpose. We cooked, it was easy to chew, and it gave us more free time, so we were able to innovate! Interesting theory, but surely intriguing.</p>\n<p><strong>Life is not always about achieving it all. It&#8217;s sometimes about the journey. You can&#8217;t always win. You have to learn from the journey and move on.</strong></p>\n<p>When I look back I do see, my decision to invest worked out many ways. <strong>As I diversified my venture it was a good move.</strong> I made many mistakes and described in details here as well, but I tried to learn and reflect that in my further life. I am who I am, because of the journey. I don&#8217;t regret any part of it. If I had the chance would I have done it differently? I don&#8217;t know, maybe that could be a different journey. My life is wrapped up entirely with WordPress, I am and will always be proud of that. But maybe I need to give myself a fair chance to see the world clearly. For past 13-14 years, I have worked every day on an average 14 hours of more, I still stay at the office for over 12 hours. But I don&#8217;t do it because I have to, I do it because I enjoy it. But this is taking too much of my life, I am too swamped up. This break is necessary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I really like to thank Topher &amp; HeroPress for giving me this opportunity and pushing me on writing this. I was very confused as it turns out this BIG. I thought it was just 2500-3000 words, I wrote almost on the fly, so was not looking at word count. Probably this is kind of my thing, if an idea is clear in my head, I don&#8217;t have issues putting it into letters.</em></p>\n<p><em>Topher told me this is twice the size of the previous longest essay in HeroPress. <strong>I am glad if you read it completely! That&#8217;s also an achievement!</strong> Then why not spent few second more to say Hi in the comments, so I could know who read this far!</em></p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Retiring%20Young%20From%20Bangladesh%2C%20Thanks%20To%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F&title=Retiring+Young+From+Bangladesh%2C+Thanks+To+WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/083017-150x150.jpg&description=Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/" title="Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/">Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 00:00:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"M Asif Rahman";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Akismet: Akismet and Drupal, Together Again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1960";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/08/29/akismet-and-drupal-together-again/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1569:"<p>Akismet is used on millions of WordPress sites, but it isn&#8217;t only used with WordPress.

We have challenges (user frustrations with publishing and customizing, competition from site builders like Squarespace and Wix) and opportunities (the 157 million small businesses without sites, aka the next big market we should be serving). It’s time for WordPress’ next big thing, the thing that helps us deal with our challenges and opportunities. The thing that changes the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic has been moving towards offering better support for small businesses with its 2015 <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce" target="_blank">acquisition of WooCommerce</a> and steady commercialization of Jetpack, with plans targeted at business owners. The company is poised to capture even more of the self-hosted small business market by allowing customers to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem" target="_blank">tap into WordPress&#8217; third-party ecosystem</a>.</p>\n<p>However, many vocal opponents to Gutenberg (and the changes that will come along with it) are concerned that the project is being developed chiefly to serve Automattic&#8217;s customers and corporate interests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg has been mainly introduced by one particular company which seems to be in urgent need to compete with other SaaS businesses,&#8221; WordPress theme development company owner <a href="https://www.mhthemes.com/" target="_blank">Michael Hebenstreit</a> said. &#8220;That’s fine, but then keep it as a plugin for at least 1-2 years, put it on WordPress.com (to gather real live feedback and usage data) and nobody will have any issues with that approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg addressed concerns that Gutenberg is being developed for Automattic&#8217;s customers in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587598" target="_blank">reply</a> to a similar comment on his post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There definitely is a contingent that seems to think that, but if you think through it logically it doesn’t make sense: if it were just to benefit Automattic it would be far easier and more advantageous to just do Gutenberg unilaterally in Calypso, where it would primarily benefit WordPress.com,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Doing it in wp-admin and core first involves a lot more discussion, public feedback, backwards compatibility concerns, and breaking a lot of new ground for how core uses Javascript, and because it’s in core the benefits will accrue to all hosts of WordPress, many of which directly or indirectly compete with Automattic. We are reading and trying to learn from all the negative feedback though, even when it’s from people who haven’t used Gutenberg much yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those who build websites for clients have voiced concerns about how Gutenberg will affect their businesses, whether the brand new interface will drive users away from WordPress. Developers and product owners are eagerly awaiting more answers on what it means for existing plugins and themes in the ecosystem, as the project has yet to iron out some of the more technical details regarding extensibility and support for metaboxes. This naturally raises concerns about Gutenberg&#8217;s timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready, not vice versa,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We still have target dates to help us think about scope and plan for all the supporting documentation, translation, and marketing efforts, but we’re not going to release anything until Gutenberg is something the team working on it agrees is ready.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress users have been conditioned to anticipate releases on a regular schedule but the new approach to core development will allow for the next major release to wait until the targeted features are ready. Mullenweg confirmed in the comments of his post that Gutenberg will ship with a legacy interface to offer backwards compatibility for PHP metaboxes that have not yet updated to be JS-powered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some things like toolbar buttons will definitely need to be updated to work with Gutenberg, other things like Metaboxes there will be no problem to provide a legacy interface for a few releases,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;But I would say that plugin authors should start updating their plugins in late September if they want to benefit from Gutenberg’s launch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the most prevalent concerns that remains is React&#8217;s licensing issues, which came to a head after the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook’s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses for Apache PMC members. Facebook&#8217;s engineering directors considered re-licensing the project but <a href="https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license" target="_blank">decided against it</a>, citing &#8220;meritless patent litigation&#8221; as the reason behind adopting the BSD + patents license. The WordPress project has yet to announce its stance on the decision.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We anticipated a decision on React around the Apache deadline (closer to now), will have more to announce about WP and Gutenberg’s approach here in the next few weeks,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>He also reiterated how invested he is in the WordPress project and ecosystem as a whole. His post elaborated on the many benefits he anticipates for plugin, theme, and core developers, agencies, users, and hosting companies. He challenged the WordPress community to see Gutenberg in the same light.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My life’s work is improving WordPress,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I firmly believe that Gutenberg is the direction that will provide the most benefit to the maximum number of people while being totally in line with core WordPress’s philosophies and commitment to user freedom. So keep giving us your feedback, and let’s push through the fear together. It’s worth a little discomfort to change the world.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 18:01:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"Matt: We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47503";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9263:"<p>Movable type was about books, but it wasn’t just about books.

The thing that changes the world.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>For those who don’t know we kicked off the Gutenberg project around the beginning of the year, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/06/4-8-and-whats-coming/">I talked about it and we did our first public releases in June</a>, and the team has been doing <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-editor/">weekly updates</a> of the public beta plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">that&#8217;s available for anyone to try out in their wp-admin</a>.</p>\n<p>When Johannes Gutenberg’s press came out, people mostly used it to print the same religious text monks had been copying. It wasn’t until ten or fifteen years later that people started innovating and trying their hands at new kinds of writing, and the wheels of change started to spin faster. Now it’s WordPress’ turn to do the same. Gutenberg meets our challenges and opportunities head on while simultaneously benefitting everyone who makes a living working in the WP ecosystem. It’s about a lot more than just blocks. Our Gutenberg moves every part of the WordPress ecosystem forward:</p>\n<p><strong>Developers and agencies</strong> will be able to create interactive templates that clients can easily update without breaking things or dealing with custom post types: Imagine a custom “employee” block that you can add to an About page that includes a picture, name, and bio. They’ll be able to replace most meta boxes, and they’ll get a chance to update old code or clients to work in this new paradigm.</p>\n<p><strong>Plugin developers</strong> will be able to completely integrate into every part of WordPress, including posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars without having to hack TinyMCE or squeeze their entire feature behind a toolbar button. Today, every plugin that extends WordPress does it in a different way; Gutenberg’s blocks provide a single, easy-to-learn entry point for an incredible variety of extensions. Some folks have already begun to port their plugins over, and are finding that they&#8217;re easier to build and have a much improved UI. I&#8217;m looking forward to highlighting those stories as we get further along and more people write about them.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme developers</strong> won’t need to bundle tons of plugins or create their own page builders. There’ll be a standard, portable way to create rich layouts for posts and guide people through setup right in the interface, no 20-step tutorials or long videos needed. Every theme will be able to compete with multi-functional premium themes without locking users into a single theme or compromising their experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Core developers</strong> will be able to work in modern technologies and not worry about 15 years of backwards compatibility. We’ll be able to simplify how menus, widgets, and the editor work to use a common set of code and concepts. The interface will be instantly responsive.</p>\n<p><strong>Web hosts</strong> will have better signup rates, as Gutenberg opens up WordPress to an entirely new set of people for whom WordPress was too complex and hard to set up before. (Remember our goal: to democratize publishing.) Their churn rates will go down: they’ll stop bleeding customers to Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace, and fewer people will abandon their sites because it was too hard to make things look they way they wanted.</p>\n<p><strong>Users</strong> will finally be able to build the sites they see in their imaginations. They’ll be able to do things on mobile they’ve never been able to before. They’ll never have to see a shortcode again. Text pasted from Word will get cleaned up and converted to blocks automatically and instantly. (I pasted the first version of this post from Google Docs and it worked <em>great</em>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f44c.png" alt="👌" class="wp-smiley" />) They’ll start manipulating their sites in ways that would have taken a developer. They’ll be able to move from blogging to using WordPress as a CMS without missing a beat. Editing posts will just work; they’ll write more. They’ll learn blocks once, and then be able to instantly use and understand 90%+ of plugins.</p>\n<p>I could go on about how photographers will be able to create rich galleries, parallax images, and better portfolios, or how poets will finally be able to preserve whitespace as they write, but you get the idea. It’s big. It moves the WordPress ecosystem forward, but it also moves the whole web forward.</p>\n<p>Which is scary! Because change always is, and this is a big one. But a scary thing is usually a thing that leads to growth, if you can push through it. Ten years ago, agencies and developers worried that software like WordPress would ruin their business because clients wouldn’t need help updating their sites any more, and would maybe even just start building their own sites. But their worse fears didn’t come true — instead, it created new opportunities for everyone.</p>\n<p>(People were worried when the printing press was invented, too. A Swiss biologist warned against the “confusing and harmful abundance of books,” but I’d say it all worked out in the end.)</p>\n<p>This is not to say that nothing will go sideways with Gutenberg, or that people’s concerns about it are unfounded. Making something people want is really hard to do and easy to mess up — we definitely have in the past. I share many of the concerns or worries with today’s version of Gutenberg, and we’re working to mitigate them. Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready, not vice versa. We still have target dates to help us think about scope and plan for all the supporting documentation, translation, and marketing efforts, but we’re not going to release anything until Gutenberg is something the team working on it agrees is ready.</p>\n<p>And as we work, we’re listening: feedback on core and feature plugins gets read, heard, and considered. Every review of Gutenberg, even the rude ones, has a response. Seven months of vigorous and public debate, chats, tickets, and code changesets brought us to where we are today, and there will be  a fair amount more before we can present the Gutenberg vision in a mostly-complete state. I welcome it; apathy would worry me a lot more than disagreement or controversy.</p>\n<p>Creating great software will never make every person happy. We’re not creating The Perfect Product, we’re choosing a path between many good options, weighing all of the inevitable trade-offs that come from a change, listening, shipping, and then doing it all over again. Iterating. My life’s work is improving WordPress. I firmly believe that Gutenberg is the direction that will provide the most benefit to the maximum number of people while being totally in line with core WordPress’s philosophies and commitment to user freedom. So keep giving us your feedback, and let’s push through the fear together. It’s worth a little discomfort to change the world.</p>\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote blocks-quote-style-1"><p><em>Yes, it is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams, the most abundant and most marvelous liquor that has ever flowed to relieve the thirst of men.</em></p>\n<em>Johannes Gutenberg</em>\n</blockquote>\n<img src="https://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2017/08/metalmovabletypeedit1.jpg?w=604&ssl=1" />\n<p><em>Thank you to the <a href="https://wptavern.com/morten-rand-hendriksen-on-what-gutenberg-means-for-the-future-of-wordpress">WP Tavern conversation</a> that helped me write down many of these ideas, and <a href="https://kingofstates.com/">Michelle Weber</a>.

I live in a society where women are not allowed to work in an office. People in my society think that all women have to do is take care of her family and stay at home. Narrow minded society. But I feel proud to say that I am not part of that narrow minded society.</p>\n<p>I am so engaged in the world of the Computer and Technology since school time. I started learning about basic computer languages HTML, CSS and C. And believe me I was so good at it! Later on I choose Computer Engineering for my further study and completed Bachelor of Computer Applications. But I didn’t stop studying after that. I completed my Masters in Computer Applications.</p>\n<p>I fell in love with the programming and working as freelancer. What is most interesting is that the platform I am associated with. WordPress! Everyday I woke up with a new task and go to sleep with a new idea. And that still goes on. I am a WordPress developer at the Elsner Technology and I am so proud of whatever work I do everyday.</p>\n<p>With WordPress it feels like home, a part of my soul. And hey! it’s not the house of boys, there are so many girls associated with WordPress. In case if you don’t know WordPress theme review team is led by women. And since my society is not filled with the open-minded people I suggest “Girls, why don’t you learn/work/code from home?” After all, all you need is just a computer and an internet connection. Right? There are billions of things that you can do with this platform and you don’t even need to pay a penny.</p>\n<p>WordPress is easy and designers like that. And who knows the better color combination and design better? You got the point. There are thousands of self-employed developers and designers using WordPress. In addition the rapid female created themes on platform can itself testify to the fact that women want to make websites too, and organizations like Women Who WP are so useful and makes the process more easy. WordPress is creating more and more for business owners and women are really good at tech businesses. And India is the house of the Startup business. Even the government is also making huge efforts behind it.</p>\n<p>The Internet is saturated with WordPress. 27 percent of the entire internet relies on WordPress. From small startup to gigantic companies. Since my society is willing to keep women in the house, I would like to say that’s great. I am okay! I can work from home. But there is no excuse to sit back and let the boys have all the fun. There are plenty of ways to get involved in the WordPress community. And nothing is better than a girl who writes code.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id="gujarati">ભારતીય મહિલાઓ માટે વર્ડપ્રેસ સારું છે?</h1>\n<p>શા માટે કમ્પ્યુટિંગ હંમેશા &#8216;છોકરાઓ નું ક્લબ છે? હું એવા સમાજમાં રહુ છે જ્યાં સ્ત્રીઓને ઓફિસમાં કામ કરવાની મંજૂરી નથી. મારા સમાજના ઘણા લોકો એવું વિચારે છે કે બધી જ મહિલાઓએ તેના પરિવારની સંભાળ રાખવી અને ઘરમાં રહેવું. રૂઢિચુસ્ત મનનું સમાજ છે પરંતુ મને ગર્વ લાગે છે કે હું સાંકડા વિચારોવાળી સમાજનો ભાગ નથી.</p>\n<p>હું સ્કૂલના સમયથી કમ્પ્યુટર અને ટેકનોલોજીના વિશ્વ સાથે સંકળાયેલી છું. તે સમયે મેં કોમ્પ્યુટર ની ભાષાઓ એચટીએમએલ, સી.એસ.એસ. અને સી વિશે શીખવાનું શરૂ કર્યું. અને મારો વિશ્વાસ કરો હું તેના પર ઘણી સારી હતી. પછીથી મેં મારા આગળના અભ્યાસ માટે કમ્પ્યુટર એન્જિનિયરિંગ પસંદ કર્યું અને બેચલર ઓફ કમ્પ્યુટર એપ્લિકેશન્સમાં અભ્યાસ પૂર્ણ કર્યો. પરંતુ તે પછી મેં અભ્યાસ કરવાનું બંધ કર્યું નથી. મેં કમ્પ્યુટર એપ્લિકેશન્સમાં માસ્ટર્સ પૂર્ણ કર્યું.</p>\n<p>હું પ્રોગ્રામિંગમાં ખૂબ ખોવાયેલી રહેતી હતી અને સાથે ફ્રીલાન્સર તરીકે કામ કરતી હતી. સૌથી રસપ્રદ બાબત એ છે કે જે પ્લેટફોર્મ સાથે હું સંકળાયેલી છું તે વર્ડપ્રેસ છે. દરરોજ હું એક નવા કાર્ય સાથે જાગું છું અને નવા વિચાર સાથે સૂઈ જઉ છું. અને તે હજુ પણ ચાલુ છે. હું એલ્સ્નર ટેક્નોલોજીમાં વર્ડપ્રેસ ડેવલપર છું અને દરરોજ મેં જે કંઈ કર્યું છે તેના પર મને ગર્વ છે.</p>\n<p>વર્ડપ્રેસ સાથે ઘરની જેમ લાગે છે, મારા આત્માનો એક ભાગ. અને હા! તે છોકરાઓનું જ ઘર નથી, વર્ડપ્રેસ સાથે ઘણી સ્ત્રીઓ પણ સંકળાયેલી છે. એક વિષયમાં જો તમને ખબર ન હોય તો વર્ડપ્રેસ થીમની પરીક્ષણ ટીમની આગેવાની મહિલાઓ દ્વારા કરવામાં આવે છે. અને કારણ કે મારું સમાજ ખુલ્લા લોકોથી ભરેલું નથી તેથી હું સૂચવે છે કે, &#8220;સ્ત્રીઓ, તમે શા માટે ઘરેથી શિખવાનું/કામ કરવાનું /કોડ કરવાનું ચાલુ નથી કરતાં?&#8221; છેવટે, તમને જરૂર ફક્ત એક કમ્પ્યુટર અને ઇન્ટરનેટ કનેક્શનની છે. સાચું ને ?

Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gutenberg-morten-rand-hendriksen">considers Gutenberg</a> to be a watershed moment, &#8220;This is a revolution,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a watershed moment for WordPress. This is entirely new and fundamentally different from how WordPress works and how we work with it today. I cannot overstate it enough when I say this changes everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen suggests that Gutenberg will allow WordPress to graduate from being a blogging platform to a platform for managing views. If Gutenberg adds complexity to the user interface, he predicts many users will migrate to simpler, hosted publishing systems.</p>\n<p>He also predicts that due to the REST API and Gutenberg, permanent fractures may develop between different segments of the community and user base.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting to think about what could happen to WordPress and the web in general if Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s optimism comes to fruition. &#8220;Whatever happens to WordPress’ user base, once Gutenberg is implemented fully, WordPress’ role in the wider web and internet community will change,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If all these things actually work, and people find them useful, WordPress will herald in a new age of UI and UX exploration.

Participants and subscribers to the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191" target="_blank">GitHub thread</a> waited weeks for a decision on re-licensing while Facebook&#8217;s engineering directors discussed the matter internally. The request has now formally been <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/" target="_blank">denied</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to apologize for the amount of thrash, confusion, and uncertainty this has caused the React and open source communities,&#8221; Facebook engineer Adam Wolff said. &#8220;We know this is painful, especially for teams that feel like they&#8217;re going to need to rewrite large parts of their project to remove React or other dependencies. We&#8217;ve been looking for ways around this and have reached out to ASF to see if we could try to work with them, but have come up empty.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The request for re-licensing had received 851 &#8220;thumbs-up&#8221; reactions on GitHub and many developers commented to say that the ASF&#8217;s policy disallowing the BSD+Patents license <a href="https://wptavern.com/petition-to-re-license-react-has-been-escalated-to-facebooks-engineering-directors" target="_blank">affects their organizations&#8217; ability to continue using React</a> and other open source projects from Facebook. Others said they would like to use React but the licensing makes it impossible for their companies.</p>\n<h3>Facebook Cites &#8220;Meritless Patent Litigation&#8221; as the Reason Behind Adopting the BSD + Patents License</h3>\n<p>Wolff&#8217;s <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing Facebook&#8217;s decision said that the team has not done a good job of communicating the reasons behind its BSD + Patents license and offered a more in-depth explanation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As our business has become successful, we&#8217;ve become a larger target for meritless patent litigation. This type of litigation can be extremely costly in terms of both resources and attention. It would have been easy for us to stop contributing to open source, or to do what some other large companies do and only release software that isn&#8217;t used in our most successful products, but we decided to take a different approach. We decided to add a clear patent grant when we release software under the 3-clause BSD license, creating what has come to be known as the BSD + Patents license. The patent grant says that if you&#8217;re going to use the software we&#8217;ve released under it, you lose the patent license from us if you sue us for patent infringement. We believe that if this license were widely adopted, it could actually reduce meritless litigation for all adopters, and we want to work with others to explore this possibility.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The ASF&#8217;s decision to disallow the BSD+Patents license was for policy reasons, not a legal decision based on incompatibility. Greg Stein, commenting on behalf of ASF on a separate GitHub issue, <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om/issues/882" target="_blank">said</a> that the ASF didn&#8217;t want downstream users of Apache code to be surprised by the PATENTS grant that was previously in RocksDB and is still in React. The organization wanted users to have no further constraints other than following the ALv2.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While we respect this decision, it hurts to see so many great ASF projects get churned for policy reasons after using this license for years,&#8221; Wolff said in Facebook&#8217;s announcement. The company made it clear that they will not be re-licensing React or any other projects simply to satisfy ASF&#8217;s policy requirements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have considered possible changes carefully, but we won&#8217;t be changing our default license or React&#8217;s license at this time,&#8221; Wolff said. &#8220;We recognize that we may lose some React community members because of this decision. We are sorry for that, but we need to balance our desire to participate in open source with our desire to protect ourselves from costly litigation. We think changing our approach would inhibit our ability to continue releasing meaningful open source software and increase the amount of time and money we have to spend fighting meritless lawsuits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many from the OSS community expressed disappointment and frustration in their initial reactions on Twitter:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">“People like to sue us,” is a poor rationalization.

Doesn&#8217;t look like a map, yet, does it? </p>\n<p>When the post is previewed or published, you will see the map like this:</p>\n<div class="googlemaps"></div>\n<p>The map is not a screenshot. It is interactive. Zoom in and out and move around on the map. The <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/google-maps/" title="Google Maps — Support — WordPress.com">Google Maps shortcode</a> taps into the Google Maps API allowing a live section of the map to be embedded on your site to help people find locations and directions. </p>\n<p>Google Maps are a great way of providing instructions to the location of a store or company on a Contact web page. They are also fun to embed in a post about a favorite park, hike, fishing hole, vacation spot, or even create a custom map that charts your travels, hikes, or a specific route for shopping or exploring. </p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Google Map embeds are tricky. You need to search for the exact address and use that embed code. If you search for a business name, you may get an invalid server request from Google Maps. Also note that WordPress.com has made it easier to use shortcodes by skipping the extra code and converting links and embed codes automatically to shortcodes. This may require saving your post as a draft twice before you can see the results on the front end preview of the post or Page.</em></p>\n<p>Shortcodes allow the user to add content and functionality to a WordPress site without knowing extensive code or digging into the programming of a WordPress Theme or Plugin. With the shortcut of a shortcode, WordPress users may add all sorts of customization features to their site.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of shortcodes in the core of WordPress. WordPress Themes have the ability to enable or disable these, and add more, as do WordPress Plugins.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s experiment with the <a title="Archives Shortcode &mdash; Support &mdash; WordPress.com" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/archives-shortcode/">Archives Shortcode</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a New Page to your site. Title it &#8220;Site Map&#8221; or &#8220;Archives.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Type in <code>&#091;archives]</code>.</li>\n<li>Preview, then publish the post when ready to see a listing of all of the published posts on your site in a list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Check out my <a href="https://lorelle.wordpress.com/site-map/" title="Site Map « Lorelle on WordPress">site map</a> as an example of what&#8217;s possible. </p>\n<h3>What You Need to Know About WordPress Shortcodes</h3>\n<p>Shortcodes come with WordPress out of the box, and also with WordPress Themes and Plugins. These snippets of code allow the user to add functionality to their site without touching the code. </p>\n<p>The PHP code that enables the functionality, and adds the ability to use the abbreviated code to generate that functionality on the site, is called a <code>function</code>. </p>\n<p>At its core, this is the function found to generate all WordPress Shortcodes:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">//[foobar]\nfunction foobar_func( $atts ){\n	return "foo and bar";\n}\nadd_shortcode( ''foobar'', ''foobar_func'' );</pre>\n<p>The attributes, represented in this abbreviated version by <code>$atts</code>, are the instructions as to what the shortcode is to do.</p>\n<p>In the expanded form with functionality, I&#8217;ve called the shortcode &#8220;elephant&#8221; and set up two attribute values, &#8220;trumpet loudly&#8221; and &#8220;stomp.&#8221; </p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">// [elephant foo="foo-value"]\nfunction elephant_func( $atts ) {\n    $a = shortcode_atts( array(\n        ''foo'' =&gt; ''trumpet loudly'',\n        ''bar'' =&gt; ''stomp'',\n    ), $atts );\n\n    return "foo = {$a[''foo'']}";\n}\nadd_shortcode( ''elephant'', ''elephant_func'' );</pre>\n<p>Depending upon what &#8220;foo&#8221; and &#8220;bar&#8221; represent, the results would be &#8220;trumpet loudly&#8221; and &#8220;stomp.&#8221; What these represent are HTML code, modifications to HTML code, and initiates the programming such as generating a list of all the posts you&#8217;ve published as an archive list.</p>\n<p>Right now, you aren&#8217;t at the stage where you can program shortcodes and add them to WordPress Themes or create WordPress Plugins, so I&#8217;m not going to dive into these much deeper. You need to learn how these work and how to use them on your site, and the more you use them, the better feel you will have for what a shortcode can do on your site. </p>\n<p>WordPress.com offers a <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/category/shortcodes/" title="Support — WordPress.com">wide range of shortcodes</a> to add functionality to your site.

The project provides a beautiful experience for installing and setting up WordPress themes with all of their plugin dependencies, Customizer settings, widgets, demo content, and more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was inspired by David Baker’s <a href="https://github.com/dtbaker/envato-wp-theme-setup-wizard" target="_blank">Envato Theme Setup Wizard</a> and was working to add it to my own themes but pivoted after realizing I was just putting a band-aid on the onboarding issues surrounding themes in particular,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;It wasn’t a particularly grand experience and didn’t take care of the essentials the way I was looking for.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor said he wanted to make the onboarding experience much friendlier than what WordPress products are typically known for and needed a way to get his customers started on the right foot.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the years I’ve had countless &#8216;how do I get this page like your demo&#8217; and &#8216;where do I even start&#8217; questions — and my themes aren’t even particularly confusing/difficult to use.&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, users have to hop from screen to screen to install a theme, recommended plugins, and apply Customizer settings. Even an experienced WordPress user often has to refer to documentation to get a theme set up with the right customizations to match the demo. The video below shows an example of Merlin WP in action as it guides a user through setting up <a href="https://themebeans.com/themes/york-pro" target="_blank">York Pro</a>, a fork of one of ThemeBeans&#8217; commercial themes that is included in Merlin WP&#8217;s GitHub repo.</p>\n<div class="embed-vimeo"></div>\n<p>Merlin WP makes the process of setting up a theme nearly effortless for users. It also leaves less room for error or confusion.</p>\n<p>Developers can add Merlin WP directly to their theme files. It includes a configuration file that allows for customization of any text string in the wizard. Theme developers add the Merlin class (merlin/merlin.php) and the merlin-config.php file, along with any demo content (included in the demo directory location specified in the merlin-config.php file):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>content.xml</strong> — Exported demo content using the WordPress Exporter</li>\n<li><strong>widgets.wie</strong> — Exported widgets using Widget Importer and Exporter</li>\n<li><strong>customizer.dat</strong> — Exported Customizer settings using Customizer Export/Import</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Merlin WP was also developed to work seamlessly with <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/" target="_blank">TGMPA</a>, a PHP library that many WordPress developers use to require or recommend plugins for their themes and plugins. It will automatically pull the recommended plugins into the wizard.</p>\n<p>Tabor said his targeted distribution channel is commercial themes, though he believes Merlin WP could also be useful for themes hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m honestly not sure if it would be allowed,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;I guess that’s where getting more eyes on the project and more input from the Theme Review team comes in handy. I have had a lot of feedback from authors who are eventually considering adding Merlin WP as an &#8216;up-sell feature&#8217; for their lite offerings currently on .org.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor estimates that Merlin WP will be in beta for another two weeks. There are a few issues he wants to resolve before bringing it out of beta. He is testing the wizard in his own products at ThemeBeans, which is what he built it for originally. The shop has more than 40,000 customers and Tabor plans to push the wizard live across his entire theme collection once the last few issues are resolved.</p>\n<p>Merlin WP is GPL-licensed and <a href="https://github.com/richtabor/MerlinWP" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> for any developer to use in open source projects. Tabor said he is considering creating a pro version but is not currently interested in pursuing an add-on model.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m considering having an advanced version, with different developer-level capabilities, such as EDD Software Licensing support (where theme users can enter their license key issued from the developer in the onboarding process),&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\n<p>Tabor anticipates one of the main benefits for theme shops using Merlin WP will be a decreased support load where questions about initial setup and &#8220;how do I do this like the demo&#8221; become less common.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Customers will have what they’ve purchased right off the bat (instead of installing plugins, installing a child theme, importing content, setting menus, widgets, etc),&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;They will likely appreciate the ease-of-use and share that experience with others.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 01:19:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"Post Status: Building a healthy remote company, with Tom Willmot — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=38655";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"https://poststatus.com/building-healthy-remote-company-tom-willmot-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1876:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

To figure out why this is, Millie Macdonald and Anna Harrison of Ephox, the company behind TinyMCE, <a href="https://go.tinymce.com/blog/gutenberg-editor-success-lies-timing/">analyzed the feedback</a> and concluded that many of the issues likely stem from timing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In short, the nuances in the micro-interactions and timing of UI elements in Gutenberg are a little out of sync with what the user is doing at a point in time,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;For example, a user typing in a new paragraph is distracted when the decoration of the previous paragraph turns on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A common piece of feedback is that Gutenberg&#8217;s UI is clean but also cluttered. Harrison recorded a video of users copying and pasting paragraphs into Gutenberg and Medium.</p>\n<p>In the video, toolbars and UI elements are displayed in Gutenberg during the writing process creating a cluttered look and disrupting the writing flow. In Medium, the formatting toolbar doesn&#8217;t display until text is highlighted and the + symbol disappears if it&#8217;s not interacted with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Based on user testing, Harrison suggests refining the timing of when visual elements pop up in Gutenberg. &#8220;Right now, menus pop up when we are trying to type,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;They ought to pop up when we are trying to do something to words that have already been typed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Harrison <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2279">presented their findings</a> and suggestions to Gutenberg&#8217;s development team. Tammie Lister, design lead for Gutenberg, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2279#issuecomment-321379994">agreed</a> that getting micro-transactions right is important. &#8220;I see this as the type of refinement post version 0.9/1 can bring,&#8221; Lister said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A few things I am slightly obsessed with is having an animation pace, story and consistency to interactions. Just something to throw in when looking at micro-interactions. I&#8217;ve also been doing some self thinking about what the &#8216;feel&#8217; of emotion of Gutenberg should be. The one I keep coming back to is &#8216;calm&#8217; and &#8216;supporting&#8217;. Just another thing to throw in when looking at these smaller details.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Developers thanked Harrison and Macdonald for collecting, analyzing, and sharing data with the team. Does Gutenberg feel heavy to you? Let us know what your experience is like writing content in Gutenberg.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 23:06:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WPTavern: WordPress Support Team to Host Free Workshop August 23 on Supporting Themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74257";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-support-team-to-host-free-workshop-august-23-on-supporting-themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3074:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/colored-pencils.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Over the past few months the WordPress Support Team has been brainstorming ways to improve support across various aspects of the community. One new idea they are pursuing is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/2017/07/the-developers-guide-to-supporting-your-themes-a-support-workshop/" target="_blank">hosting workshops</a> where WordPress.org theme and plugin authors can present how they approach supporting their free, open source products that have been released to the community.</p>\n<p>Some users approach WordPress.org plugins and themes with realistic expectations regarding the support they might receive on tickets. Others approach these free products as if they were all built with large teams of professional support behind them, which is rarely the case. This often results in frustration, one-star reviews, and ultimately a bad reputation for products hosted in the official directories. It is also one of the primary reasons developers forgo putting products on WordPress.org and simply opt to host them on GitHub.</p>\n<p>The new workshops will offer concrete strategies for bridging the chasm of expectation regarding support that exists between developers and users. WordPress.org theme and plugin authors will share the tools and ideas they have implemented to offer support while creating a positive experience for everyone involved.</p>\n<p><a href="https://kpresner.com/" target="_blank">Kathryn Presner</a>, who supports hundreds of themes at Automattic, will be leading the first workshop titled &#8220;The Developers Guide to Supporting Your Themes:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Providing support for your themes offers tremendous opportunities to educate WordPress users, from explaining how to make a child theme to offering simple CSS customisations. It also presents challenges, like figuring out how to help people who aren’t tech-savvy or need support beyond the scope of what you can provide. While many developers dread doing support, with some concrete strategies and techniques in hand, helping users doesn’t have to be a chore – and can even be fun! This session looks at how to make your themes’ users happy while feeling a sense of satisfaction from your own support efforts – a winning combination in the world of theme development.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.org theme authors will want to mark their calendars for <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170823T1600" target="_blank">Wednesday, August 23 at 11 AM CDT</a>. The workshop will be broadcast live as a Zoom teleconference and will last for an hour, including time for a Q&amp;A at the end.

The plugin was created by UK-based web developer <a href="https://jonnya.net/" target="_blank">Jonny Allbut</a> for internal use at <a href="https://wider.co.uk/" target="_blank">Wider</a>, a company he set up for handling WordPress clients&#8217; needs.</p>\n<p>One aspect of complying with the EU&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eugdpr.org/" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) is ensuring that contact forms do not store any personally identifiable data on the server. The regulation becomes enforceable in May 2018 and sites that serve EU citizens are preparing for the deadline with audits and changes to how they handle privacy.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms</a> doesn&#8217;t offer a built-in option to stop entries from being stored on the server but GF co-founder Carl Hancock says there are a variety of ways to accomplish this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If all you want to do is simply email the contents of the form and not store the data in the database as part of the route you&#8217;d like to take for GDPR compliance, this plugin would be one method of doing so,&#8221; Hancock said. He also referenced Gravity Wiz&#8217;s commercial <a href="https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-disable-entry-creation/" target="_blank">Disable Entry Creation</a> plugin. Developers can also <a href="https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/delete-entry-data-after-submission/" target="_blank">delete entry data after submission</a> via a hook.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, the GDPR doesn&#8217;t preclude storing form entries in a database and is entirely dependent on the type of data you are storing and the other safeguards and functionality you have put in place,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a complex issue and I&#8217;m not entirely sure the EU fully understands the burden and implications that may come with it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the requirement of compliance falls upon website administrators who are the ones collecting the data. It is their responsibility to select tools that will protect their users&#8217; privacy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While it won’t provide GDPR compliance on its own, Jonny’s extension is a much-needed step in the right direction,&#8221; digital law specialist <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk" target="_blank">Heather Burns</a> said. Burns consults with companies that need assistance in getting their sites GDPR compliant. &#8220;GDPR requires adherence to the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/privacy-by-design-framework/" target="_blank">principles of privacy by design</a> and part of that is data minimization and deletion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress has dozens of popular contact form plugins, both free and commercial. Many of them store entries in the database in case the recipient&#8217;s email has problems, preventing the communication from becoming lost. Site administrators who are concerned about GDPR compliance will want to examine the solution they have selected for forms. Burns advised that contact form plugins need to do the following three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that personal and sensitive personal data from form entries is not stored in the database;</li>\n<li>Provide configuration options to allow contact form entries to be automatically deleted after a certain period of time;</li>\n<li>Ensure that all contact form data is deleted when the plugin is deactivated or deleted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately the direction of travel has been the exact opposite: contact form entries tend to be stored in perpetuity on the database regardless of content or necessity,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;Contact form plugins with options to automatically delete form submissions after a certain period of time are rare. I&#8217;ve even seen contact form extensions which duplicate entries to a separate table, which, all things considered, is madness. We need to be developing towards data minimization and deletion, not retention and duplication.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last month JJ Jay <a href="https://tharshetests.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/wp-contact-form-remnants/" target="_blank">published</a> an analysis of how and where popular WordPress contact forms plugins store data. This is a useful reference for site administrators who are not sure how their chosen solution handles data collection and storage. She suggested a few questions for users to ask when examining contact forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can the option to store data be turned on and off?</li>\n<li>At what granularity?</li>\n<li>Can the data be deleted when the plugin is deleted?</li>\n<li>What personally identifiable data, other than the data from each form, is stored? (i.e. <a href="https://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/10/eu-dynamic-static-ip-personal-data/" target="_blank">a user’s IP address</a>)</li>\n<li>Is it possible to delete the submissions on an ad-hoc or scheduled basis?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what could be leftover in your database from other plugins, Jay has also created a &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/tharsheblows/mjj-whats-in-my-database" target="_blank">What&#8217;s in my database?</a>&#8221; plugin that administrators can install and access under the Tools menu. It is read-only and lists every table and its columns, so users can see if there are any surprises.</p>\n<h3>British Pregnancy Advice Service (BPAS) Hack Highlights the Danger of Storing Contact Form Entries in the Database</h3>\n<p>In educating website owners about the dangers of storing sensitive personal data, Heather Burns often cites the 2012 British Pregnancy Advice Service (BPAS) hack as one of the worst examples of the consequences of storing contact form entries in databases. The hacker, who was later jailed, stole thousands of records from the charity, which was running on an unknown outdated CMS with weak passwords. The site had not undergone a privacy impact assessment on its personal data collection and storage methods.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the services BPAS offers is access to abortions,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;Many of their service users come over from Ireland, where abortion is banned under nearly all circumstances. The site had a contact form where women could enquire about abortions. BPAS thought that messages were merely passing through the site; no one within the organization had any clue that a copy of each contact form submission was stored on the database. Somewhat inevitably, the site was easily hacked by an anti-abortion activist who downloaded the database. He found himself in possession over 5,000 contact form submissions going back over five years containing women’s names, email addresses, phone numbers, and the fact that they were enquiring about abortions. He then announced his intention to publish the womens’ data on an anti-abortion forum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The hacker was caught and arrested before he had the opportunity to publish the list. He received 32 months of jail time and BPAS was fined £200k for the data protection breaches.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As well as criticizing the charity for their technical failures, the regulator called attention to the fact that no one on the staff had thought to ask the proper questions about the tools they were using; they were also angry that the site had a legalistic privacy policy which was clearly not worth the pixels it was printed on,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;All of these failures were deemed inadmissible and inexcusable by the data protection regulator. It is no exaggeration to say that women could have been killed because of a contact form.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Auditing contact forms is just one piece of the puzzle for those working towards GDPR compliance. Burns recommends that site administrators conduct a privacy impact assessment of personal and sensitive data that is submitted through forms. Privacy notices should also be clear about how this data is handled and how long it is retained before it is deleted.</p>\n<p>The GDPR was written to be extraterritorial and states that the regulations apply to any site or service that has European users. These sites are expected to protect EU users&#8217; data according to European regulations. Many American company owners are not yet convinced that this is enforceable outside of EU borders and have not invested in getting their online entities to be compliant.</p>\n<p>&#8220;GDPR provides a very useful framework for user protection, which is now more important than ever,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;I&#8217;m encouraging Americans to work to GDPR because it&#8217;s a constructive accountable framework that&#8217;s a hell of a lot better than nothing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wider-gravity-forms-stop-entries/" target="_blank">Wider Gravity Forms Stop Entries</a> is currently the only plugin in the official WordPress directory that addresses GDPR concerns for a specific contact form plugin. Others may become available as the May 2018 deadline approaches. Jonny Allbut warns users in the FAQ to test the plugin with third-party GF extensions before adding it to a live site, as some extensions may rely on referencing data entries stored in form submissions.</p>\n<p>I asked Carl Hancock if Gravity Forms might make storing form entries in the database an optional feature and he confirmed they are considering it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, this is certainly possible,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;We try to avoid conflicts with available 3rd party add-ons for Gravity Forms to encourage their development,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;But unfortunately it is not always avoidable. It is a feature that has been requested numerous times in the past and I suspect with the GDPR it will be a feature that will be requested even more going forward.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 23:03:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"Post Status: Free speech, privacy, and the web";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=38615";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://poststatus.com/free-speech-privacy-and-web/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7492:"<p>Politics and the web are intersecting more and more. In recent news, at least three WordPress related companies have been getting broad media attention.</p>\n<p>In just a few days, we&#8217;ve seen GoDaddy <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/14/16143820/godaddy-and-google-wont-host-daily-stormer-domain">shut down a site</a> for violating terms and conditions, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40454089/wordpress-bans-website-of-fascist-group-linked-to-alleged-charlottesville-killer">as well as</a> Automattic. DreamHost received significant attention for <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/we-fight-for-the-users/">refusing to release site visitor information</a> to the US Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>I think the most relevant angle for this website is to note that it&#8217;s important for web-based services to be prepared for the unexpected news cycles that revolve around web-based properties.</p>\n<p>How well does your PR team know your terms and conditions? What&#8217;s your stance on free speech, and when can that cross a line into speech or content that your service is ready to limit? The definitions can be narrow; let&#8217;s look at Automattic&#8217;s decision to shut down a site called Blood and Soil.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a despicable site, and it has been for a while. Automattic is aware of the sites that exist on WordPress.com, and this isn&#8217;t their first rodeo with objectionable sites receiving lots of backlash from advocacy groups. For instance, the Guccifer 2.0 person or group that hacked the Democratic National Committee was on WordPress.com, and they still are. There are countless others, some hacking related, some simply vile or hate-filled.</p>\n<p>So what makes a site cross the line for a particular service? GoDaddy&#8217;s Ben Butler <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40411086/activists-push-back-against-the-platforms-that-quietly-empower-hate-groups">described to Fast Company</a> that they draw the line between speech and violence:</p>\n<blockquote><p>GoDaddy&#8217;s Ben Butler described to Fast Company that they draw the line between speech and violence:</p>\n<p>“We strongly support the First Amendment and are very much against censorship on the internet,” writes Ben Butler, director of the Digital Crimes Unit for <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, in an email. He adds that, “if a site promotes, encourages, or engages in violence against people, we will take action.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The GoDaddy decision (which Google followed up with as well) was especially interesting because they made the decision as the domain registrar, not a content host. In that case they weren&#8217;t actually providing the hosting service.</p>\n<p>Automattic has similar policies. Specifically, they link to <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/user-guidelines/">user guidelines</a> within their <a href="https://en.wordpress.com/tos/">ToS</a>, which has a clause for &#8220;directly threatening material.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do not post direct and realistic threats of violence. That is, you cannot post a genuine call for violence—or death—against an individual person, or groups of persons. This doesn’t mean that we’ll remove all hyperbole or offensive language.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They also have a specific policy (not directly linked from their ToS) for <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/terrorist-activity/">terrorist activity</a>, and a provision to allow them to remove content or users for any reason.</p>\n<p>The terrorist in Charlottesville aligned himself with Blood And Soil, prompting Automattic to pull the plug —  as the line was crossed.</p>\n<p>DreamHost&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/we-fight-for-the-users/">pushback to the government</a> was about First Amendment concerns as well, primarily with visitors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The request from the DOJ demands that DreamHost hand over 1.3 <em>million</em> visitor IP addresses — in addition to contact information, email content, and photos of <strong>thousands</strong> of people — in an effort to determine who simply <em>visited</em> the website. (Our customer has also been notified of the pending warrant on the account.)</p>\n<p>That information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution’s First Amendment. That should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone’s mind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Every host deals with requests that may not require visitor information but definitely do require account information. Automattic&#8217;s Paul Sieminski provided a helpful post on the <a href="https://transparency.automattic.com/2017/07/25/shining-light-on-national-security-letters/">types of requests they get</a>, and how they handle them.</p>\n<p>The US has broad protections built into the First Amendment covering free speech. Platforms are not required to meet those protections; however, many are strident supporters of the First Amendment. Those protections are often for some of the most unpopular types of content. The Supreme Court has ruled there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/08/14/there-hate-speech-exception-first-amendment/q9m4IqfQvbo24nnlnPor1O/story.html">no hate speech exception in the First Amendment</a>, and this ruling has been cited recently in a trademark case.</p>\n<p>I think the author of the above-cited op-ed makes a good point:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We can and should speak up against hate. As the Supreme Court makes clear, there’s no hate speech exception to the First Amendment. With that freedom comes a heavy burden for government officials like Baker and Walsh, who must try to keep protected speech from turning into acts of violence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The burden is also heavy for platforms who are dedicated to providing a place for unpopular opinions. There are many times when the unpopular opinion, or anti-government opinion, is incredibly important to protect. But when speech stems over into violence, then I believe platforms have not only a right, but also a responsibility to take a stand.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important for organizations to be educated about and consistent with their own terms of service, company-wide. I&#8217;m afraid these hard questions about speech, rights, and responsibility will be pretty common for a while to come. And as fast as information spreads — for instance, the calls for GoDaddy to shut down a hate site this week came in a fury, part of a quickly viral Twitter post — acting quickly and consistently will be incredibly important.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve talked about platforms and services with some control over their user base. The obvious other side of this is that there is a whole segment of our community with no control over their users. Your theme, plugin, and WordPress itself can be used without permission by absolutely anyone, and of course that&#8217;s by design. WordPress or a WordPress-related product could be identified and criticized virally for enabling objectionable users and content</p>\n<p>As a community, are we prepared to respond to that?</p>\n<p>PS: If you&#8217;re a journalist writing about WordPress.com and issues like these, please understand the difference between WordPress.com, owned by Automattic, and WordPress the software. <a href="https://poststatus.com/resources/wordpress-versus-automattic/">I wrote a handy guide for you</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 18:38:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"HeroPress: The Greatest Screenplay Writer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2033";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:126:"https://heropress.com/essays/greatest-screenplay-writer/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=greatest-screenplay-writer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14463:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/081617-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: WordPress is not like any other open source communityI saw before." /><p>My upbringing was not quite usual Serbian upbringing. I was almost forbidden to do things I didn&#8217;t really love. My parents insisted on trying things and finding that deep passion. But I didn&#8217;t have to search and try. I always knew what I&#8217;d be when I grow up. As long as I remember, there was no doubt.</p>\n<h3>A classical musician</h3>\n<p>When I was 8 my mom took me to local music school for entrance examination. I was in! Oh, joy! Finally I was learning to play and sing, to read and write this new language. Italian. Oh, music scores too! There was a whole new world that my parents, or anyone in my family, didn&#8217;t know anything about and I was stepping into it. I was doing just fine in it.. and I couldn&#8217;t live outside of it.</p>\n<p>As time passed, I finished elementary and high music school, went to music Academy, almost finished it and then my mother died. It was 2003. Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant. There was no time for grief and I couldn&#8217;t feel the joy. I just switched off and turned to the facts: I became a mom and a wife and I needed a job.</p>\n<p>And what a job did I found. An opera prompter. Opera Prompter! God, I love that job. Every second of it for ten years. I was yelling at singers, singing, conducting, traveling, laughing and crying. My Italian was significantly improved. Working time was great &#8211; so much free time to be a mom, study for Academy, get a hobby&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Opera prompter&#8217;s hobby</h3>\n<p>In 2007 I was administrator in one English speaking forum with focus on software and hardware topics. It helped me to significantly improve my English. And my tech knowledge. Which was close to none when I registered. As one of administrators, occasionally I had to tweak site here and there. It was great! There was this code and when I would change something in code it would show on the site. Neat! I loved reading those files, finding patterns and parts written in humanly understandable forms. Later I learned those were called loops and conditionals. Also later I learned that this language is called PHP and that many other languages for building websites exist. Forum script was phpBB3.</p>\n<p>I was never a gamer. Never understood the point of game, besides finishing it. I guess PHP was to me what games are to passionate gamers. Like a puzzle or sudoku.</p>\n<p>At the same time my marriage was turning from bad into worse and in the beginning of 2008 I finally decided it was enough. We were working on Mozart&#8217;s “Don Giovanni” in Theater. I remember this so clearly because my divorce was just turning from bad into worse. Those few months lasted for centuries after which I still needed a lot of time to recover what&#8217;s left of my self-esteem. My complete mental and emotional health was destroyed after years of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>2009 was important year for me. The cognition of possibility to have local server on my own machine and test everything before executing it on live site turned out to be very helpful.</p>\n<p>In October I needed a blog script and friend recommended WordPress. It was 2.9 version. It didn&#8217;t really work well but everyone was writing about it. There were at least 5 new tutorials on various blogs every day. I was digesting them every morning with my first coffee. The ones I really liked I even reproduced in my shiny new localhost. Soon enough I developed a local monster with different widgets on each page, future posts archive, post series done with custom fields and God knows whatnot. This WordPress was slowly taking over my free time. Every second of it.</p>\n<h3>So, the WordPress it is</h3>\n<p>One day a friend of mine asked me to build him a website for his ensemble. And for money. Money? I never thought of getting money for this. This was too good of a hobby. But he&#8217;s a friend so I did it. Then another friend showed up with the same request. And another.. I became freelance WordPress developer before I could even understand what was happening. It wasn&#8217;t really a favor to friends any more. I was a single mom with mortgage. My daughter was in primary school, life costs became serious while the art-and-culture salary was silently and regularly reduced.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was freelancing every single minute I could. Sleeping was luxury I could afford on weekends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My dad was helping me tremendously. He was babysitting during theater&#8217;s rehearsals and performances in the evenings. When I&#8217;d get home, my daughter was sleeping, tomorrow&#8217;s meals cooked, dishes done and shining. I could go on like this but it was uncertain for how long.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2013 I was recovering from what was supposed to be routine gallbladder surgery and what nearly cost me life. Almost fully operational, I was getting ready for next roller coaster known as a mix of school year, freelancing and theater&#8217;s season. Then my father died. Suddenly. In an accident.</p>\n<p>Oh, this screaming silence..</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t think. Or breathe. For months. I needed someone to put the roller coaster on pause. Just.. Just a short one. To take a breathe. But there was no one. I was all alone with a 9 years old child who had to grow up fast. I had to grow up fast.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All of a sudden I realized that I can not afford a single mistake any more. I can not be ill, get in debts, lose job. Or mind. I was the only one I could count on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2014 my theater salary got reduced once again. And again in following year. 30% in total. For ten years it never covered all of my monthly expenses but this was ridiculous. It was a time for me to stop playing it safe and see what I&#8217;m made of. That was probably the most difficult decision I have ever made. A heart breaking one. Stop being musician. So I quit being Opera Prompter and started working as a full time WordPress developer.</p>\n<h3>Well, hello, World!</h3>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t really know for which wage level my knowledge was. For years I was the only WordPress developer I knew in person. The rest were all online superstars I was learning from. So I started as a shy medior and the only WordPress developer in agency. It turns out that, for this agency needs, I was senior and soon enough I was organizing and leading development processes for new projects.</p>\n<p>From the business point of view repeating similar projects makes you &#8220;niche expert&#8221;. I do understand that. But, as many other developers out there, I don&#8217;t like repeating the same tasks or projects. Not even once. I missed variety which led me to become more active contributor on wordpress.org.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For years I was just contributing to codex here and there and never really thought about all the people behind WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In my vague image, they were a bunch of really great developers and they were doing just fine. I was learning from them so I could not possibly help them. I would just be on their way.</p>\n<p>However, in my attempt to find something interesting to keep my mind amused with, I came upon <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Slack url</a> for communication between contributors on WordPress project. What a crowd! And not just developers &#8211; everyone! Doing all kinds of different bits, and all important. How odd. WordPress is not like any other open source community I saw before. So much more open and inviting! I remember reading through channels and thinking: &#8220;I could do this&#8221;, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to learn that&#8221;, &#8220;This person is funny&#8221;.. I&#8217;m gonna stick.</p>\n<h3>Antisocial extrovert in a more open open source community</h3>\n<p>No matter how I tried, and I did try, I&#8217;m just not a people person. Among other antisocial treats, over the years I have developed a heavy dark humor which, more often than not, due to lack of social interactions I reveal in a completely wrong way. But these people seem not to mind so I thought to give it a try with them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> is extremely important in WordPress community. No community wants bullies. But rare communities accept social weirdos and misfits. And this one doesn&#8217;t just accept them, it makes them feel like fits. That was a nice change.</p>\n<p>I started attending local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WP-Meetup-NS/">Meetups</a>, even gave <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WP-Meetup-NS/events/235186967/">a talk</a> on contributing to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/">Theme Review team</a> after which I was invited to join <a href="https://www.toptal.com/">Toptal platform</a> as a freelance developer. My social adventure got me volunteering on <a href="https://2017.belgrade.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Belgrade</a> and <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe in Paris</a>. I must admit there were &#8220;too many people at the same time&#8221; moments but there were lots of ways to stay involved with controlled dose of human interactions. I chose volunteering at Experts bar and it worked out just great. I really loved all the hugs though.</p>\n<p>Today I try to keep my focus on just a few channels in make WordPress slack and my contribution wish list regularly updated. One can have only so many hours in a day. Most often you&#8217;ll find me in <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fdocs">#docs</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fcore-docs">#core-docs</a> channels, doing various stuff with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/about-the-docs-team/get-involved/">Documentation</a> team.</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/milana-cap_wcbgd.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2036 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/milana-cap_wcbgd-1024x683.jpg" alt="Milana, on a rooftop baclony with some other people looking at her phone" width="960" height="640" /></a></p>\n<h3>The Questions</h3>\n<p>Among all the questions I get about my professional path, the most commons are &#8220;<strong>How come you made such a huge change from music to web development?</strong>&#8220;, &#8220;<strong>Did you go to school to become a developer</strong>?&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Do you miss being musician?</strong>&#8220;. Answer to the first question is quite easy:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Being musician and writing code are pretty much the same. They both require the same parts of your mental struggle and make you go through the same emotional tortures and enlightenments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The second question, however, is a bit more difficult to answer. In the light of the first answer, I could say that I was exposed to the required way of thinking. Practicing an instrument 6 hours per day for over a decade does teach you a couple of things about commitment. World of classical music is a world of magnificent talents and varieties which touches you all the way to the humble self where you find appreciation for being able to feel this way. Personally, I believe this is extremely important for developer &#8211; to be humble and grateful to person who helped them find this humbleness.</p>\n<p>No, I don&#8217;t have a formal developer&#8217;s education. It doesn&#8217;t seem to prevent me from being developer. And no, I don&#8217;t miss being musician. Because I never stopped being one. I listen to classical music while I code and play piano when I have a difficult programming problem to solve.

The login flow has been completely redesigned to provide a more unified experience for connecting both self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. These flows were completely separate in the past and users were often confused about which one to select. The new design provides fewer opportunities for friction when logging in, an experience that likely determines many users&#8217; first impressions of the app.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/self-hosted-login-wp-mobile-apps.png?ssl=1"><img /></a>Self-hosted login on mobile apps\n<p>&#8220;As we reimagined the login experience, there were a few key principles guiding us: keep it simple, minimize the distinction between a site hosted at WordPress.com versus somewhere else, and avoid anything that might be too clever,&#8221; Automattic mobile lead Eric Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Users can now connect new sites by entering the URL and the mobile apps will automatically detect if the site is hosted on WordPress.com or not. The new login flow ferries users on to the next step based on what kind of site is being connected. This is available in version 8.0 of WordPress for Android and version 8.2 of WordPress for iOS.</p>\n<p>The new login experience emphasizes the ease of using magic links for logging into WordPress.com. If the user enters and email address, the app will generate an authentication link and send it via email. This allows users to login without having to remember or enter a password.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/new-login-experience-wp-mobile-apps.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If a user is entering the world of WordPress for the first time through the mobile apps, the new login experience also offers a short tour of the some of the features included in the app. These include WordPress.com features such as notifications, Stats, and the Reader. The apps, despite being marketed as the official WordPress mobile apps, are a product of Automattic and include a commercial upgrade path for WordPress.com services.</p>\n<p>The idea of the apps functioning as a gateway to help the greater WordPress ecosystem gain more users (and eventually see some graduate to self-hosted sites), no longer seems credible now that WordPress.com has <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem" target="_blank">entered the hosting space by allowing its customers to tap into third-party plugins and themes</a>.</p>\n<p>The updated login experience, while more convenient for users, continues to blur the line between self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. WordPress for Android and iOS used to have their own separate blogs but all of the news is now funneled through WordPress.com&#8217;s news blog and the @WordPressiOS and @WPAndroid Twitter accounts seemed to have been abandoned in favor of marketing updates through WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>In the past, many in the WordPress community have asked why the apps are not called the WordPress.com mobile apps, since they include features that are not central to the core publishing experience for self-hosted users. Last year when I <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-5-7-adds-path-to-upgrade-wordpress-com-plan" target="_blank">interviewed</a> Maxime Biais, one of Automattic’s mobile engineers, he said the team had considered splitting the product into two apps.</p>\n<p>“We considered having both WordPress and WordPress.com apps, but we rejected this because it doesn’t make it more clear,” Bias said. “It’s probably even more ambiguous when someone searches the Play Store for &#8216;WordPress&#8217; or &#8216;Blog&#8217; and finds both WordPress and WordPress.com apps.”</p>\n<p>Now that that mobile apps have become a direct pipeline for new WordPress.com hosting customers, it may be time to re-visit the consideration of splitting the apps into two distinct products: one for WordPress.com&#8217;s commercial interests and one that officially represents the open source WordPress project for self-hosted users without any corporate interests. If the project&#8217;s official mobile apps are a key part of new users&#8217; onboarding experience, they should accurately represent the software as an independent platform that can be hosted with and extended by any number of free and commercial products in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 06:33:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: WordCamp US to Experiment With A Community Bazaar";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74138";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-to-experiment-with-a-community-bazaar";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2237:"<p>In addition to taking place in a new location this year, <a href="https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US</a> will have a <a href="https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/attendee-information/community-bazaar/">Community Bazaar</a>. An area will be set aside in the venue allowing those chosen to showcase their WordPress communities.

Two years after Human Made began searching for a buyer, maekit purchased WP Remote to integrate it with the company&#8217;s existing platform that caters to designers managing multiple clients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Remote had remained a much-loved product with its users and despite receiving no ongoing development it had remained an iconic plugin in the WordPress community,&#8221; Human Made CEO Tom Willmot said.</p>\n<p>maekit took over WP Remote operations in March after closing the deal. According to maekit CEO Matt Holme, the company inherited 20,000 users with 120,000 WordPress websites. His team has maintained WP Remote in its original platform for the past few months before integrating it into maekit last week.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wpremote.com/" target="_blank">WP Remote</a> has offered unlimited, free WordPress site management (updating core, plugins, and themes with a single click) since 2010. It hasn&#8217;t received ongoing development for several years, but maekit plans to add backup features that will make bring it more up to speed with competitors like MangeWP, MainWP, and InfiniteWP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We definitely plan to keep WP Remote free and expand its features,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;Specifically we are looking at offering easy-to-manage cloud-based backup services. For example, hook up your Dropbox (or any other popular cloud based storage system) and schedule regular backups of your WP websites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>maekit&#8217;s acquisition of WP Remote gives the company&#8217;s customers the ability to deploy WordPress sites with one click and manage client sites and domains through a unified, white-labeled invoicing and payment system. The company has rolled out a few long-overdue bug fixes to WP Remote and Holme says the rest of maekit is functional but still technically in a closed beta mode.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our revenue model revolves around direct sale hosting plans and also reselling integrated hosting plans for other leading global hosting providers,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;We are refining the free invoicing and payment processing system built into maekit so that a maekit / WP Remote user can deploy a new hosted WP and charge their client a recurring monthly fee and retain the mark up they add on top of our base hosting prices as profit. This means literally no out of pocket expense for maekit / WP Remote users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although maekit&#8217;s one-click deployment service supports many popular CMS&#8217;s and e-commmerce platforms, including WordPress, Opencart, Drupal, Magento, and Joomla, Holme said the vast majority of the company&#8217;s customers are running on WordPress. Acquiring WP Remote brings a host of valuable new features to maekit&#8217;s customer base. maekit&#8217;s built-in client billing features, customized for freelancers and agencies, are what Holme says will differentiate the company from its competitors in the WordPress space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a great deal of respect for these other WP management platforms and feel the size of the WP market means there is opportunity for all to succeed,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;With the features of maekit also including new website deployment, invoicing, payment processing and client management, our platform is unique from the others.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 03:50:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.8.0 Introduces 5 New Blocks: Categories, Text Columns, Shortcode, Audio, and Video";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74090";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:110:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-8-0-introduces-5-new-blocks-categories-text-columns-shortcode-audio-and-video";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5712:"<p>Gutenberg <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11th-august/" target="_blank">0.8.0</a> was released over the weekend with five new blocks, major improvements to existing blocks, and support for more publishing features that have been missing from the new editor&#8217;s sidebar.

Depending on testing, it may not be the implementation that ends up landing in the plugin permanently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been over how difficult it is to get columns right, and also how already today third parties can build this,&#8221; Joen Asmussen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2117#issuecomment-319347010" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We may very well want an entirely different implementation than this one. But perhaps it&#8217;s good to get this in now and test it. Perhaps this can help inform how a better column implementation can work down the road. In fact we might want to merge this block in now, only to take it back out later again, same as the Cover Text block. For that reason, I think it&#8217;d be good to test this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new Video and Audio blocks are geared towards inserting files that have already been uploaded to the media library. However, I found the text on the video block to be confusing. If I was new to WordPress and didn&#8217;t understand how oEmbed works, I would be clicking inside the video block to figure out where to paste the URL.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/video-block.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The new Audio and Video blocks mirror the same kind of functionality that users have experienced when adding images to their sites. In the future, contributors may introduce more features to the audio block, such as additional playback types and looping, but the first iteration includes just the basics.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 0.8.0 adds resizing handlers to the existing Image Block, making it easy for users to insert and quickly resize an image. If you review the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2213" target="_blank">GitHub ticket</a> for this feature, it&#8217;s clear that it was not easy to implement. Image resizing has gone through several changes and may have more down the road, especially as it pertains to the behavior of the caption. Ultimately, the caption field should not be wider than the image so that the two are placed together.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/image-resizing-gutenberg.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release introduces a post formats selector to the post settings sidebar. It includes a suggestion based on what blocks are in use in the post. One participant on the ticket noted that the suggestion gives too much importance to the post formats selection and might be confusing to users. The suggestion persists, despite a user switching the format to the one suggested. This is because Gutenberg cannot detect if it was explicitly set by the user or if the user selected the suggestion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I happen to agree with you: post formats should go away,&#8221; Joen Asmussen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2307#issuecomment-321232074" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;In fact part of the genesis of blocks as a concept is to provide a better interface than what post formats did.

Through ensuring good defaults, wrapping and bundling advanced layout options blocks, and making the most important actions immediately available, authoring content with WordPress should be accessible to anyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The idea is to simplify content creation for users so that they only have to learn one interface &#8211; the block interface. The design document adds several new sections that elaborate on the concept of &#8220;everything is a block&#8221; and includes best practices that developers can reference when designing their own blocks.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:18:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 10:36:56 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 10:15:11 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130911040210";}', 'no');

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry''s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.', '1.jpg'),

Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ''lorem ipsum'' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

Just as JavaScript is a near necessity for smoother user experiences and more modern PHP versions are critical for performance, SSL just makes sense as the next hurdle our users are going to face.</p>\n<p>SSL basically means the link between your browser and the server is encrypted. SSL used to be difficult to implement, and often expensive or slow. Modern browsers, and the incredible success of projects like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> have made getting a certificate to secure your site fast, free, and something we think every host should support by default, especially in a post-Snowden era. Google also weighs <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html">SSL as a search engine ranking factor</a> and will begin <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-will-soon-shame-all-websites-that-are-unencrypted-chrome-https">flagging unencrypted sites in Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>First, early in 2017, we will only promote hosting partners that provide a SSL certificate by default in their accounts. Later we will begin to assess which features, such as API authentication, would benefit the most from SSL and make them only enabled when SSL is there.</p>\n<p>Separately, I also think the performance improvements in PHP7 are particularly impressive, and major kudos to everyone who worked on that. We will consider whether hosts use PHP7 by default for new accounts next year as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4588";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"WordPress 4.7 Release Candidate";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-release-candidate/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 04:26:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4579";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:328:"The release candidate for WordPress 4.7 is now available.

Highlights include a <a href="http://2017.wordpress.net/">new default theme</a>, video headers, custom CSS, customizer edit shortcuts, PDF thumbnail previews, user admin languages, REST API content endpoints, post type templates, and more.</p>\n<p>We’ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/src?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=39353&amp;stop_rev=39263&amp;limit=200&amp;verbose=on&amp;sfp_email=&amp;sfph_mail=">quite a few refinements</a> since releasing Beta 4 a week ago, including usability and accessibility enhancements for video headers, media and page template support in starter content, and polishing of how custom CSS can be migrated to and extended by plugins and themes. The REST API endpoints saw a number of bugfixes and notably now have anonymous comment off by default.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start with testing?

We&#8217;ve been working on a lot of things, many of them to make getting your site set up the way you want it much easier. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://2017.wordpress.net/"><strong>Twenty Seventeen</strong></a> &#8211; A brand new default theme brings your site to life with immersive featured images, video headers, and subtle animations. With a focus on business sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and more. Personalize its asymmetrical grid with a custom color scheme and showcase your multimedia content with post formats. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Headers</strong> &#8211; Sometimes a big atmospheric video as a moving header image is just what you need to showcase your wares; go ahead and try it out with Twenty Seventeen. Need some video inspiration? Try searching for sites with video headers available for download and use.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up your site in one flow</strong> &#8211; From finding and installing themes right inside the customizer, to automatically staged theme-specific starter content, to clickable shortcuts that jump directly to editing an item from the preview pane, to adding pages while you&#8217;re building a nav menu or setting a static front page: getting a new site spun up and ready to share with a friend or a coworker is faster and easier than it&#8217;s ever been. Note: starter content appears when live previewing brand new sites and is currently only available in Twenty Seventeen. We&#8217;ll be expanding this to other bundled themes very soon, and perhaps to sites with existing content in future releases of WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom CSS with live previews</strong> &#8211; Ever needed to hide or tweak the look of something in your theme or from a plugin? Now you can do it with CSS and live preview the results while customizing your site. CSS can be a powerful tool; you may find that you won&#8217;t need the theme editor or child themes anymore.</li>\n<li><strong>User admin languages</strong> &#8211; Just because your site is in one language doesn&#8217;t mean that everybody helping manage it prefers that language for their admin. To try this out, you&#8217;ll need to have more than one language installed, which will make a user language option available in your profile.</li>\n<li><strong>PDF thumbnail previews</strong> &#8211; Uploading PDFs will now generate thumbnail images so you can more easily distinguish between all your documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, there have been exciting changes for developers to explore as well, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API content endpoints</strong> &#8211; If you only test one thing as a developer, please test these. This phase is particularly helpful for people building plugins, themes, and in-admin interfaces. Can you build the things you need? Are these ready for release, and is the world ready for them?

Daniel Bachhuber, the project&#8217;s official maintainer, has launched an experiment to fund ongoing maintenance and new development, asking potential patrons, &#8220;<a href="http://wp-cli.org/blog/the-big-question.html" target="_blank">How much is WP-CLI worth to you?</a>&#8221; Options for contributions range from $100/yr &#8211; $7500/yr.</p>\n<p>This particular funding experiment is not asking for one-time contributions but rather follows a subscriber model where patrons will be billed annually. Bachhuber said he has a number in mind in order to consider the funding a success but he is not going to share it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to see if this is a viable approach for funding a for-profit business,&#8221; Bacchuber said. He plans to fully refund subscribers if the campaign doesn&#8217;t reach its goal.</p>\n<p>Last year Bachhuber <a href="https://wptavern.com/a-more-restful-wp-cli-kickstarter-campaign-is-now-187-funded" target="_blank">raised $32,822</a> in a highly successful Kickstarter campaign from 107 backers, which funded development during the first part of 2016. After the campaign he started a business called <a href="https://runcommand.io/" target="_blank">runcommand</a> that offered enterprise support and custom development for hosts and agencies. This was an attempt to help subsidize his time spent on WP-CLI, but it didn&#8217;t work out the way he planned:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The business is doing alright, not great but not horrible. What I’ve come to realize, though, is that my time is zero-sum. I’m incentivized to spend time on runcommand, when I’d rather spend it on WP-CLI.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the challenge I’m running into is opportunity cost. I’d love to be able to invest more into WP-CLI, but doing so comes at the cost of other business pursuits. Because WP-CLI is such a large project, the several hours I volunteer each week are basically enough to fight entropy — not make headway on larger initiatives.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bachhuber said he hopes this patron-esque model will scale so he can hire a few people to work on WP-CLI, helping reduce his bus factor and creating a stronger contributor base.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The project itself is at a point where it needs dedicated attention from maintainers, not occasional changes from contributors,&#8221; Bachhuber said in response to commenters on the post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will, however, echo other comments here in regards to the wish for a public roadmap, more transparency, marketing efforts, and more in regards to the business being built upon WP-CLI,&#8221; subscriber Pippin Williamson said. &#8220;I have chosen to make my subscription payment as a donation to the project, not as a purchase/ of the product / service because, at this time at least, there&#8217;s not really anything I get out of it beyond continued development of the project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Williamson said the new <a href="https://runcommand.io/wp/doctor/" target="_blank">wp doctor</a> and <a href="https://runcommand.io/wp/profile/" target="_blank">wp profile</a> commands would not be of much use to him or his team. He also suggested that Bachhuber sell a professional subscription that offers a library of additional commands for popular plugins, such as WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, WP Migrate DB Pro, and Gravity Forms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve come to appreciate is that WP-CLI will be far more successful in the long-term by building all of these in the open, instead of a more traditional model of making some selection of them paid-access,&#8221; Bachhuber said.</p>\n<p>Subscriptions will help fund the ongoing maintenance of WP-CLI, the creation of new commands, and improvements to the website and package index.</p>\n<p>For a project that is geared almost exclusively towards developers, there&#8217;s a surprisingly low number of contributors to its development. The brunt of it falls to Bachhuber as the official maintainer. His campaign puts the impetus on subscribers to help improve the tools they use every day through monetary contribution.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, funding the organization will also precipitate a culture shift resulting in more developers who are motivated to get their hands dirty and become personally invested in the code base. Funding one person&#8217;s time is not the most effective way to keep a project afloat and may not do much to reduce the bus factor on the project unless Bachhuber can hire or inspire more maintainers.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This year, I''ve spent 308 hours on <a href="https://twitter.com/wpcli">@wpcli</a> (140 paid, 168 volunteer).

Regular photos and panoramas are also now viewable in VR. The VR gear tested so far includes Cardboard, Gear, Daydream, Rift, and Vive.</p>\n<p>Uploading VR content works just like adding normal pictures and videos. Users can then add 360° photos and videos to posts using a &#8220;vr&#8221; shortcode. The Harvard Gazette&#8217;s <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/10/confronting-the-refugee-crisis/" target="_blank">Confronting the Refugee Crisis</a> story is one live example of the new VR content in action:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vr-example.gif?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vr-example.gif?resize=523%2C526&ssl=1" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64503" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make publishing VR content as simple as publishing text or photos to the web,&#8221; Automattic team lead Toni Schneider said. Schneider, who is <a href="https://toni.org/2016/06/06/comparing-the-vive-to-the-rift/" target="_blank">a big VR fan himself</a>, led the team to bring VR capabilities to WordPress.com. He <a href="https://toni.org/2014/10/29/my-vr-memory/" target="_blank">worked in a VR startup</a> in the 90&#8217;s after college and has been a VR fan ever since.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the re-emergence of VR, it struck me that WordPress can play a role in making VR content easy to create and access for everyone, just like we did for text and photos,&#8221; Schneider said. His team at Automattic uses VR for collaboration and Schneider said &#8220;hearing [teammates&#8217;] voices in their proper spatial locations makes for a more natural and seamless collaboration experience&#8221; that feels less forced than a screenshare or video chat.</p>\n<p>Immersive storytelling driven by VR technology is also finding its way into the publishing industry. As part of his article in <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/collection/predictions-2017/" target="_blank">NiemanLab&#8217;s Predictions for Journalism 2017</a> series, Mario García, a media consultant and adjunct professor at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, predicts that &#8220;storytelling using VR will be easier to achieve, and more members of the audience will be prepared to welcome it.”</p>\n<p>García cites the The New York Times and its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/the-daily-360" target="_blank">Daily 360</a> section as one of the first publications to experiment with the medium. WordPress.com uses a similar UI, as you can see on the Harvard Gazette example, with an overlay that indicates VR content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One form of storytelling that will gain momentum: virtual reality,&#8221; García said. &#8220;It’s no coincidence: Editors and publishers are looking for ways to tell stories on mobile devices, and the future of virtual reality is also on mobile. For many newsrooms, VR is going to be the one big area for experimentation in 2017.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress.com is ready to ride this trend, making immersive storytelling available to all users &#8211; from large publications to small blogs. A few plugins, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/vr-views/" target="_blank">VR Views</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-vr-view/" target="_blank">WP-VR-view</a>, are already available for self-hosted sites, and WordPress.com plans to make its VR capabilities more widely available to the WordPress world soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will be in Jetpack soon, as soon as the next Jetpack release comes out,&#8221; Schneider said. &#8220;The technology is built to work on all WordPress sites and even beyond that, on any web site. We consider this first release just a start. As soon as we see how people use it, we will start adding more features and supporting more types of VR experiences.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 17:39:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"Matt: Another Dongle";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46982";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"https://ma.tt/2016/12/another-dongle/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:508:"<p>One of my favorite new .blogs is The Dongle blog, at dongle.blog.

Mullenweg floated the idea of a WordPress Growth Council &#8211; a collection of individuals and organizations interested in contributing to WordPress&#8217; growth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have very direct competitors in Squarespace, Weebly, and Wix,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Wix is a public company so it&#8217;s actually possible to see their numbers and look at things. This year alone there&#8217;s about a quarter billion dollars being spent in marketing by proprietary systems that compete against WordPress. That&#8217;s more spent in one year than has ever been invested in all of the WordPress companies combined since they started. That&#8217;s more money spent in marketing than for many consumer brands.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress has grown organically over the past 13 years through the power of its community, without expensive advertising campaigns or traditional marketing initiatives. For the first time, Mullenweg is looking to tap a segment of the community that hasn&#8217;t often been directly involved in contributions &#8211; people and organizations with large scale marketing expertise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we could do a lot to figure out a roadmap for countering this huge marketing spending being directed against us, because we are the big guy here,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We are the 26% and they are like a 1%. But even though they&#8217;re smaller, they might be cannibalizing some of the most valuable aspects of the WordPress customer base.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just before WordCamp US, he formalized the idea with <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/12/wp-growth-council/" target="_blank">a post on his blog</a> and an open invitation for council member applicants:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nNever have there been more threats to the open web and WordPress. Over three hundred million dollars has been spent in 2016 advertising proprietary systems, and even more is happening in investment. No one company in the WP world is large enough to fight this, nor should anyone need to do it on their own. We’d like to bring together organizations that would like to contribute to growing WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href="http://mcm.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-growth-council" target="_blank">survey for potential council members</a> asks them to share what they bring to the table as well as a few ideas about the growth of WordPress so far, how it can be accelerated, and how the project can best respond to the millions of dollars competitors are spending in advertising. Responses have already started coming in.</p>\n<p>Alexa Scordato, VP of Marketing at Stack Overflow, <a href="http://alexascordato.com/the-wordpress-growth-council-an-experiment-in-open-source-marketing/" target="_blank">applied to be part of the council</a>. She said her experience as a long-time WordPress user and marketing executive has motivated her to help improve the overall consumer experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been tinkering with self-hosted WordPress sites since 2007 and I’ve helped probably 100+ individuals and organizations explore the merits of the .com and .org experience,&#8221; Scordato said. &#8220;Let’s get real – the relationship is confusing, the admin panel is intimidating, and the learning curve is steep. The product marketer in me is itching to help streamline the value proposition across these funnels to help make it easier to educate and on-board new users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She is also an advocate for the open web and sees WordPress as a key player in combating the threat of walled gardens and closed systems that diminish user freedoms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While many enterprises are beginning to invest more in open source projects, there’s an imbalance in the force,&#8221; Scordato said. &#8220;The fact that an open source platform like WordPress powers 27% of the web makes it the greatest agent in defending Internet freedom.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nuno Morgadinho, co-founder of WidgiLabs and co-organizer of WordCamp Lisbon, is another applicant to the growth council who <a href="http://www.morgadinho.org/2016/12/03/wp-growth-council/" target="_blank">published</a> thoughts on what it should address. He thinks WordPress needs to take a hard look at attrition before considering advertising.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As important as advertising is, a lot of businesses struggle and fail, not because they aren’t adding new users, but because they are lousy at keeping the ones they’ve got,&#8221; Morgadinho said. &#8220;We have to look at ourselves and see where we are losing users rather than just desperately try to reach new ones. Most people use things based on referrals.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What Will the Growth Council Look Like?</h3>\n<p>After WordCamp US, I had the opportunity to ask Mullenweg a few questions about what types of applicants he&#8217;s hoping to attract to the council. He said he envisions it will function very much like a working group or mastermind group where council members learn from each other.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not necessarily only people at larger companies &#8211; the biggest contributions will come from people who currently are or have in the past managed some sort of large promotion of something,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t need to be WordPress. Maybe they sold Starbucks. Large advertising campaigns are what we&#8217;re trying to counter so experience for that is a good precondition for participating in the growth council.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said he has received applications from people whose companies aren&#8217;t in the WordPress ecosystem but who are experienced in this area and want to contribute some night and weekend hours to help out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I imagine there will be other folks, including from Automattic, that are going to be spending budgets of tens of millions of dollars in the coming year and want to talk about that,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;There are some things that could be shared, including publicly. Everyone who does marketing does some research first. Why don&#8217;t we open up that research? That&#8217;s part of what I want to encourage. By taking an open source approach to this, doing more sharing both within the council and in the wider WordPress community, I think there&#8217;s a lot more to learn.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said the meetings won&#8217;t be completely open, as companies may want to share some confidential information. The council may have some house rules in place to make it a safe space for companies to share what they are doing and to keep strategies safe from competitors.</p>\n<p>In 2017 Mullenweg has committed to putting on the &#8220;product lead&#8221; hat for WordPress core development and it seems he&#8217;ll be bringing that same approach to the growth council.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Advertising is just a product, just like an interface is, just like a website is, just like anything else,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of opportunity there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During his WordSesh session he outlined a few initial objectives for the council to tackle, including figuring out why the project has grown so far and understanding where the community&#8217;s resources are currently being spent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We should try to enumerate and track what is being spent right now, add up all the advertising, affiliate fees, and sponsorships of events,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Determine what that adds up to so we know what is the gap we need to close and the relative arsenals on both sides.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said he would like the council to figure out a plan for advertising where &#8220;we&#8217;re not competing with each other but really directing that outward against the folks who might go to Wix or Squarespace.&#8221; This particular aspect may be a challenge, as the council will need to avoid the appearance of serving only larger corporate interests in the fight against external threats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These external threats and proprietary threats are far bigger than any intra-WordPress open source threats,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We can grow the pie far faster than we can take shares from people in the same pie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For the past three years, WordPress has consistently added 2% to its market share each year without any form of advertising. Instead of the project continuing to get by on &#8220;marketing happenstance,&#8221; as Mullenweg put it in the State of the Word address, 2017 will be the first year that WordPress makes a coordinated marketing effort to change the growth curve.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The people power of WordPress is probably the thing that contributes most to the usage of WordPress,&#8221; Mullenweg said. The growth council&#8217;s challenge with advertising is producing that same magnetism on a larger scale without tarnishing the organic quality of the message. Can they come up with a marketing campaign that captures the essence of what WordPress is to the people who love it most? If the council is successful, it stands to have a positive impact on the WordPress economy as a whole.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 19:50:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: UpdraftPlus Acquires WP-Optimize, Will Be Integrated Into UpdraftCentral";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=64460";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"https://wptavern.com/updraftplus-acquires-wp-optimize-will-be-integrated-into-updraftcentral";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4048:"<p><a href="https://updraftplus.com">UpdraftPlus</a>, a European company that maintains a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">backup plugin by the same name</a> with nearly 1M active installs, <a href="https://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-confirms-acquired-wp-optimize/">has acquired</a> the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/">WP-Optimize</a> plugin.

WP-Optimize will become part of a suite of plugins that make up <a href="https://updraftplus.com/updraftcentral/">UpdraftCentral</a>, a service that allows users to manage sites remotely.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/WPOptimize.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64466" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/WPOptimize.png?resize=819%2C673&ssl=1" alt="WP Optimize Settings Page" /></a>WP-Optimize Settings Page\n<p>In an effort to simply the process of optimizing databases, Rabin created WP-Optimize to automates tasks such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removing all unnecessary data (e.g. trashed/unapproved/spam comments, stale data) plus pingbacks, trackbacks and expired transient options</li>\n<li>Compact/de-fragment MySQL tables</li>\n<li>Perform optimizations without the need for running manual queries</li>\n<li>Show database statistics and potential savings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WP-Optimize started as a personal project but when Rabin discovered that other users were looking for similar functionality, he uploaded the plugin to WordPress.org, &#8220;It ended up being a much bigger project than I imagined; when I connected with other people, I was suddenly opened up to a world of new challenges,&#8221; Rabin said. &#8220;I was encouraged to constantly improve the software’s functionality and compatibility, as well as the support information available.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the plugin&#8217;s popularity and user base increased, it eventually became too much work to support and maintain. Rabin received a few acquisition offers over the years but decided not to sell, &#8220;For me, WP-Optimize’s legacy was of prime importance. I didn’t set it up to make money, but to help out as many people as possible,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons Rabin accepted UpdraftPlus&#8217; offer is his familiarity with the plugin and its business model, &#8220;Even though they are business-driven, they still have a great freemium ecosystem,&#8221; Rabin said. He also appreciates the company&#8217;s enthusiasm and drive to take the product to the next level.</p>\n<p>David Anderson, founder and lead developer of UpdraftPlus, says the acquisition makes perfect sense, &#8220;Although we see a lot of revolution on the outside, the WordPress core has been stable for a long time, and as such, there will always be a need for database optimization in order for sites to run efficiently.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As part of the acquisition, Rabin will take on an advisory role in its continued development. Multisite support, a commercial version with additional features, and the ability for users to control it remotely through UpdraftCentral, are among the top priorities in development.</p>\n<p>Since the acquisition, UpdraftPlus has released a new version of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/changelog/">WP-Optimize </a>that Anderson says paves the way for future developments, &#8220;This release has a complete re-factoring of the plugin’s internals, to lay a solid foundation for future improvements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Although it looks the same outwardly, it has been modernized and solidified,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;We have a great and growing team, a lot of experience in the internals of WordPress and also a lot of users who trust and depend on us. There’s plenty of opportunity for us to expand.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 19:39:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"HeroPress: Changing Careers with WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1525";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/essays/changing-careers-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8191:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/121416-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: Anyone who says it''s easy to change your life is lying to you." /><p>Working in WordPress full time did not come quickly, directly, or in the ways I expected, and it was worth every step of the way. I started out in marketing in the music industry and ended up as the project manager at a WordPress development agency nearly 10 years later. Changing careers is a lot of work and none of it happens by accident. Here’s a story about how I took some dashed hopes and an economic crash and turned it into everything I ever wanted.</p>\n<p>I started out by moving to NYC the day I graduated college to work in the music industry. Armed with my BA in English, I found my way in &#8211; I don’t care what anyone says, my English degree is my secret weapon.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you can’t communicate effectively and hold someone’s interest in the process, it doesn’t matter how many letters you have after your name or how many specialized degrees you hold.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, once I established myself as a project manager a major record label in the big city, it wasn’t easy to stay. I loved New York, but I did not love working nights to make ends meet. Realizing that my career in the music industry might not be something I could do long-term, I enrolled part-time in an accredited web development diploma program. All the classes were online, so I could do classwork around my work schedule. However, the record label was bought out and privatized, and the new owners instituted a 50% reduction in headcount worldwide. I tried to look at it as a blessing in disguise &#8212; more time to spend on completing my diploma while working fewer hours as a temp! But, answering phones and entering data didn’t exactly make me want to get out of bed in the morning. I tried to focus on shifting gears to becoming a developer.</p>\n<h3>Becoming A Developer</h3>\n<p>Though I got a great base of knowledge in HTML, CSS, PHP, Photoshop, light JavaScript, and, yes, Flash and ActionScript, I didn’t really have the goods to get a programming job right away. I was eventually re-hired in a different position by the record label, but this time I was slowly but surely working more digital into my marketing position. Finally, I had done enough to get another job as the head of digital marketing for a boutique music and entertainment-focused agency.</p>\n<p>Though I was finally doing the type of work I wanted to do, I was starting to feel like New York wasn’t where I needed to be. One major pull was my long-distance NY to LA relationship. Sometimes, career is just not enough to keep you in one spot, so in June of 2011, I moved to Orange County, CA.</p>\n<p>I was able to continue working remotely for the entertainment PR firm, but I wanted a more meaningful connection with the artists I was working with. I started freelancing for select bands, and then found a position handling all things internet-related for an Orange County-based artist management company.</p>\n<p>It was an absolute dream &#8211; I was the social media voice for one of my favorite bands, plus many more new clients and projects I would have loved even if I wasn’t on the management team. In the interest of meeting new people in this new place as well as learning something, I started attending the Orange County WordPress Meetup at Zeek Interactive and learned how to take my general knowledge of PHP and apply it to this CMS that everyone seemed to be talking about. As some of our up-and-coming bands needed websites, I’d volunteer to build them. It was cost-effective for the client, and it gave me a chance to try out all the things I’d learned at the OCWP meetup. I also served as internal project manager for sites built by an external agency.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I learned more from the many mistakes I made in developing websites than I did anything else.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Coding myself into a corner was an opportunity to grow through asking someone else to show me where I went wrong. For a while, the OCWP developer night featured some time for someone to get up in front of everyone, walk the group through an issue they were working on, show their steps and reasoning, and ask for assistance. All the more experienced developers in the room were very kind to me, several of them going out of their way to help me learn new concepts to make my themes even better.</p>\n<h3>Branching Out</h3>\n<p>Bands don’t need websites all that often, and I wanted to keep learning, so I found some non-entertainment website work to do on evenings and weekends. For a lot of it, I was a second pair of hands for another developer. For others, friends or friends of friends would come to me for help with their small business sites. These small sites worked out great, but I fully understood that the way I was working had a ceiling to it. If it’s a relatively small site with not a lot of traffic to scale, I could help. If it was going to be a big site that a lot of people would see, my code would probably not be ideal. I knew enough to be dangerous, and I knew how to fix a site if and when it white-screened, but not enough to implement all the latest and greatest techniques.</p>\n<p>So, I started looking to get back into my first love: project management, only this time for websites instead of musicians. Thankfully, my friend Steve Zehngut suddenly found himself with a need to replace his PM, and after we talked through goals and methods of working, we made it official.</p>\n<p>I’ve been the project manager at Zeek Interactive for two years now, and it’s been everything I could have ever hoped for. It took nearly a decade, retraining, lots of late nights and weekends spent learning new things and getting way outside my comfort zone, but I successfully changed industries and careers. Anyone who says it’s easy to change your life is lying to you. But I’m hard-pressed to find a reason not to do it anyway if you want to make new and better things happen.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Changing Careers with WordPress" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Changing%20Careers%20with%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchanging-careers-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Changing Careers with WordPress" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchanging-careers-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchanging-careers-wordpress%2F&title=Changing+Careers+with+WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Changing Careers with WordPress"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/changing-careers-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/121416-150x150.jpg&description=Changing Careers with WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Changing Careers with WordPress"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/changing-careers-wordpress/" title="Changing Careers with WordPress"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/changing-careers-wordpress/">Changing Careers with WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 12:00:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Sarah Wefald";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"WPTavern: Harare, Zimbabwe Hosts Its First WordCamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=64419";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"https://wptavern.com/harare-zimbabwe-hosts-its-first-wordcamp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3497:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wordcamp-harare.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wordcamp-harare.jpg?resize=1025%2C560&ssl=1" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-64426" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.techzim.co.zw/2016/12/wordcamp-2016-harare-learning-pictures/">Limbikani Soul Makani Kabweza</a>\n<p><a href="https://2016.harare.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Harare</a>, the first ever WordCamp in Zimbabwe, was held over the weekend at the Harare City Library.

Kabweza is a contributor at <a href="http://www.techzim.co.zw/" target="_blank">Techzim</a>, a Zimbabwean tech publication that runs on WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As Techzim (and the other startups we work with like <a href="http://www.soccer24.co.zw/" target="_blank">Soccer24</a> and <a href="http://www.pindula.co.zw/news/" target="_blank">Pindula</a>) the internet is our lifeblood, so a day dedicated to discussing internet platforms and how to do things better was the amazingly enriching experience we expected it to be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Co-organizer Charles Muzonzini, who works as a web and mobile app developer with <a href="http://www.csz.org.zw/" target="_blank">The Computer Society of Zimbabwe</a>, said, &#8220;WordCamp Harare 2016 was an awesome success, far exceeding my expectations. Everything was on point and I’m glad to have met so many great people and learnt so much. This is hands down the best IT conference this year.&#8221; Muzonzini is also a co-organizer of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Harare-WordPress-Meetup/" target="_blank">Harare WordPress Meetup</a>, which now has 82 members.</p>\n<p>Job Thomas, who works as an Education Vanguard at Automattic, traveled from Cape Town to speak about WooCommerce at the WordCamp.

That release was the culmination of effective leadership and effort from Jen Mylo and Liz Danzico. In order to learn why this release is in a class of its own, we must look at how it was created.</p>\n<h2>Introducing Crazyhorse</h2>\n<p>On March 29th, 2008, WordPress 2.5 &#8220;Brecker&#8221; <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">was released</a> to the world. The biggest feature in 2.5 was the redesigned backend that was built in collaboration with <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a>.</p>\n<p>When Mullenweg gave the public a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/">sneak peek</a> at the redesigned backend, he had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For the past few months, we’ve been working with our friends at Happy Cog — <a href="http://zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a>, and <a href="http://bobulate.com/">Liz Danzico</a> — to redesign WordPress from the ground-up. The result is a new way of interacting with WordPress that will remain familiar to seasoned users while improving the experience for everyone. This isn’t just a fresh coat of paint — we’ve re-thought the look of WordPress, as well as how it’s organized so that you can forget about the software and focus on your own creative pursuits.</p></blockquote>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/WordPress25PostEditor.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64399" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/WordPress25PostEditor.jpg?resize=1008%2C643&ssl=1" alt="WordPress 2.5 Post Editor" /></a>WordPress 2.5 Post Editor\n<p>While some people <a href="http://socializedsoftware.com/2008/03/30/wordpress-25-review/">praised the redesign</a>, others <a href="http://scottberkun.com/2008/wordpress-25-review/">were not happy</a>, particularly with the menu hierarchy. Since sentiment in the community was mixed, Mylo contracted Ball State University’s Center for Media Design, Insight and Research to <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/usability-testing-report-25-and-crazyhorse/">perform a usability report</a> on the WordPress 2.5 admin design. The report was used to figure out which issues were based on interface problems versus people simply not liking the changes.</p>\n<p>Usability <a href="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2008/10/wp-testreport-205-crazyhorse-1028a08jw.pdf">testing results</a> were shared with lead developers which inspired a prototype interface to address some of the issues discovered. This allowed developers to use WordPress 2.5 on their own sites and the prototype on a test site. However, once testing began with the prototype interface, it became clear that a more ambitious approach was required.</p>\n<p>According to Mylo, the second prototype known as &#8220;Crazyhorse&#8221; blew test subjects away:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The second round of testing blew everyone away. The research team had never seen such consistent results. Tasks were completed faster, participant opinions rated it higher, understanding of how interface elements worked was greater, and it wasn’t even a fully functional application. Of the test participants, every single one said they would choose the prototype over their current administrative interface, and it wasn’t even pretty.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Throughout the 2.7 development process, Mylo used a number of communication channels to gather user feedback. On September 15th, 2008, Mylo published a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/09/wordpress-27-navigation-options-survey/">Navigation Options Survey</a>. The survey was part of a broader effort to get more people involved in the design and decision process:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As part of the mission to increase user involvement in design decisions, we’ve created a survey intended to give WordPress users the ability to play a part in deciding how the navigation options should be grouped and labeled.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Later that month, a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/09/wordpress-2-7-survey-no2/">second survey</a> was created that allowed users to vote on mockups of the search box, favorites menu, the Future/Publish and Edit Timestamp buttons. It only took two days for the survey to reach its maximum response count of 5,000.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CrazyhorseWireframe.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64416" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CrazyhorseWireframe.png?resize=894%2C666&ssl=1" alt="Crazyhorse Wireframe" /></a>Crazyhorse Wireframe\n<p>Once the survey concluded, Mylo <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/wordpress-27-wireframes/">published a follow-up post</a> as well as a document containing <a href="https://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/wf-dashboard_v002_093008jw.pdf">wireframes</a> that gave users an idea of what the end product might look like. Near the middle of October, 2008, Mylo <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/the-visual-design-of-27/">published</a> semi-polished screenshots of the 2.7 interface and explained how it worked. Matt Thomas and Andy Peatling are largely responsible for the design of WordPress 2.7.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/WordPress27Dashboard.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64418" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/WordPress27Dashboard.png?resize=597%2C753&ssl=1" alt="WordPress 2.7 Dashboard" /></a>WordPress 2.7 Dashboard\n<p>The response to the screenshots was <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/the-new-27-dashboard/">overwhelmingly positive</a>. A week after showcasing the 2.7 dashboard, Mylo <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/10/calling-all-wordpress-loving-icon-designers/">asked the WordPress community</a> to create a set of icons to go with each of the navigation sections. More than a dozen people submitted icon sets and instead of choosing one, Mylo <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/11/wordpress-27-project-icon/">let the community vote</a> on which set best matched WordPress 2.7&#8217;s style. With 35% of the vote, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/11/the-results-of-project-icon/">winning set</a> was created by <a href="http://bendunkle.com/">Ben Dunkle</a>.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/BDIcons.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64421" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/BDIcons.png?resize=147%2C479&ssl=1" alt="Ben Dunkle''s Winning Icon Set" /></a>Winning Icon Set\n<p>I asked Dunkle what inspired him to create the icons and if Mylo didn&#8217;t offer the opportunity to the community the way that she did, if he would have contributed to WordPress 2.7 otherwise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I saw Jen&#8217;s post calling for icon designers to submit a set for 2.7, it was right at the deadline,&#8221; Dunkle told the Tavern. &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember how I found the post, since I didn&#8217;t visit the WordPress development blog very often. I&#8217;d been building sites with WordPress for few years by that time, and really enjoyed it, but I didn&#8217;t think much about the online community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Jen expressed the direction eloquently: &#8216;Icons should be subtle, with a classic/designed look, nothing cartoonish. Thin lines. Maybe a little old-fashioned looking.&#8217; I was designing icons for other open source projects around that time, and the language of the post struck a chord with me. I rushed out an email.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I ended up as a finalist, pushed the pixels, and sent off the design. Mine got the most votes. The contest caused some controversy, since anything resembling spec work has always been a lightning rod in the design community. I didn&#8217;t see it that way. It was an open source project and I was a volunteer, not a contractor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, it launched an ongoing connection that I maintain to this day. They&#8217;re now called Dashicons, made with vectors instead of pixels, and soon to be SVGs instead of web fonts (once we get the bugs sorted out).&#8221;</p>\n<p>After going through the beta and release candidate stages, WordPress 2.7 &#8220;Coltrane&#8221; was <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/">released to the public</a> on December 11th, 2008. More than 150 people contributed code directly to the release and countless others contributed with valuable feedback during opportune times through surveys, mailing lists, and testing.</p>\n<p>Referring to WordPress 2.7, longtime user Ozh <a href="http://planetozh.com/blog/2008/12/a-journey-through-five-years-of-wordpress-interface/">had this to say</a>, &#8220;The dev team asked users what they wanted and what they liked, and the result is light years beyond what the design studio produced for 2.5 six months earlier. One word to summarize it all: &#8216;Above the fold!''&#8221;</p>\n<h2>WordPress 2.7 Set a Great Standard</h2>\n<p>During Contributor day at WordCamp US 2016, I asked Mullenweg if the WordPress 2.7 development process inspired the experimental approach to developing WordPress in 2017.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yeah, I mean that was one of the beginnings to Jen&#8217;s contributions and her huge impact on the WordPress world. She brought an entirely different way of thinking with a user first, usability, research led mindset. It was fantastic to have female leadership demonstrating very early on in the WordPress community that this is software made by everyone for everyone. What that was for its time is a great standard to hold ourselves up to as we move forward in 2017.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Out of all the WordPress releases I&#8217;ve covered since 2007, WordPress 2.7 is special. It&#8217;s the only release where I feel like a lot of the community rallied together and focused on making WordPress better. Through surveys, comments, blog posts, testing, and reaching out to talented people in the community for help, Mylo proved that the community can be part of the development and design process of WordPress and end up with a better product as a result.</p>\n<p>Things have changed since 2008. The community, contributor pool, and the project itself has become larger. Communication is spread out among the Make Blogs as well as SlackHQ. The WordPress development process is more open now than ever before. Since WordPress 2.7&#8217;s release, I haven&#8217;t felt the same spark of rallying together for a common goal that Mylo was able to foster. Perhaps it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not part of a project team like the REST API or I&#8217;m not searching for it in the right places. I hope those feelings are rekindled in 2017.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how the new development process works out. Until then, I leave you with a wonderful quote from Mylo as it succinctly captures the way I feel and remember the WordPress 2.7 development cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope you enjoy getting an inside look at how we’ve been organizing our thoughts around 2.7, and that when the community feedback starts flowing everyone remembers that we all want the same thing: the best WordPress possible.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 01:56:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: State of the Word, 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46950";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"https://ma.tt/2016/12/state-of-the-word-2016/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2117:"<p></p>\n<p>The full video and Q&amp;A from 2016&#8217;s State of the Word last week in Philadelphia is now online.

The team chosen to host in 2018 will need to be planning throughout 2017 and should be present on the ground in Paris, so the selection process is already underway.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe is currently WordPress&#8217; largest community event, and support and mentorship have been a key part of its success. Petya Raykovska, a past organizer, said the prospect of organizing the event can be intimidating for new teams but mentors will be available to applicants throughout the process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mentors are supposed to help the local teams prepare a better application,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;They are all experienced WCEU organizers who can help with many aspects of the planning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Host city selection is based on more than two dozen factors, including organizer experience, location, venue, and budget considerations. One of the most challenging aspects is securing a venue that can accommodate 3,000 attendees, but applicants are given a lot of flexibility on the event date.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We ask volunteers to book a venue for 3,000 people,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;Not only are there not many venues that can fit us at this scale, most of them are booked years in advance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Raykovska said organizers can book dates anywhere from May 1 &#8211; June 31, 2018. This makes it possible to have more cities and venues vying to host the event.</p>\n<p>Raykovska volunteered in Leiden in 2013 and helped organize WordCamp Sofia after that. In 2014, she applied to host WordCamp Europe in Sofia along with Tina Kesova, Nikolay Bachiyski, Veselin Nikolov, and Mario Peshev. Since that time she has been involved in organizing the event and mentoring newcomers. Potential applicants are encouraged to get in touch if they are wondering if their team has what it takes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes these conversations serve as a reality check,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;People can get super enthusiastic about organizing without having an idea of the time commitment. We want WCEU to be a positive experience for organizers and make sure our local teams have enough people and are aware what it takes to get involved as a local host.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2016/12/08/apply-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/" target="_blank">Applications for host city</a> will be open through February 15, 2017 and the decision will be made by the end of February. The team selected for 2018 will then join the 2017 planning team to gain a better understanding of the process. Potential applicants who want to be matched to a mentor can get in touch by emailing host at wp-europe.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In late 2013, one tweet pushed the WordCamp Sofia team to apply to host WCEU,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;It turned into the most incredible journey I&#8217;ve taken so far with stops further beyond the future host cities of Seville, Vienna, and Paris. It&#8217;s time for someone to write the next chapter of the story.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Dec 2016 23:44:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"Post Status: Photos from Post Status Publish and WordCamp US 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=31040";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"https://poststatus.com/photos-post-status-publish-wordcamp-us-2016/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52709:"<p>Last week was a whirlwind of events.

US. I unfortunately didn&#8217;t get to any sessions other than Matt&#8217;s State of the Word. But thankfully they&#8217;ll all be up on WordPress.tv, so I can catch up on the many that I wanted to attend.</p>\n<p>All photos directly before and during Matt&#8217;s <a href="https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/">State of the Word</a> are by Brian Richards. I took most of the hallway shots.</p>\n\n<a href="https://poststatus.com/photos-post-status-publish-wordcamp-us-2016/wcus-2016-1/"><img width="150" height="100"

Contributor Day was on Sunday. In addition to the contributor area itself, lunch was at the market where you can choose from a variety of lunch spots, with common cafeteria seating. I had an awesome spicy roast pork sandwich from Dinic&#8217;s, which I took a few pictures of as well.</p>\n\n<a

Founders Dan Norris and Alex McClafferty bootstrapped WP Curve in 2013 and have processed 105,000+ jobs through its pipeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Curve complements GoDaddy’s expanding WordPress offering including Managed WordPress and the recent ManageWP addition,&#8221; the company said in the announcement.</p>\n<p>Existing customers will be on-boarded to GoDaddy accounts with their current subscriptions. After the transition, the newly acquired WP Curve team will assist in scaling the services to support GoDaddy&#8217;s WordPress customers. Norris plans to exit the company and McClafferty will lead the team at GoDaddy.</p>\n<h3>GoDaddy&#8217;s Plans for WP Curve</h3>\n<p>Gabe Mays, head of WordPress Products at GoDaddy, said the WP Curve acquisition is an important part of GoDaddy&#8217;s goal to become &#8220;a one-stop shop for WordPress professionals.&#8221; Roughly one third of all GoDaddy sites are running on WordPress, and half of all new sites are using the software. This is one of the reasons GoDaddy plans to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-passes-27-market-share-banks-on-customizer-for-continued-success" target="_blank">invest in improvements to WordPress&#8217; core customizer component</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Curve will help us in two ways,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;First we’re adding WP Curve’s WordPress experts to the company and we’ll leverage their expertise to improve the training and tools for the hundreds of GoDaddy Customer Care representatives that support our customers globally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Second, we’ll directly offer WP Curve&#8217;s services to our customers,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;This combination will be amazing for our customers and create a compelling one-stop shop for WordPress professionals and their clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays said WP Curve&#8217;s services &#8220;will continue to be offered as standalone services&#8221; but GoDaddy may consider adding them to its hosting plans sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Down the road it&#8217;s possible we&#8217;ll see aspects integrated into our Hosting plans to improve the customer experience, especially for nascent WordPress users,&#8221; Mays said.</p>\n<p>Mays would not comment on whether GoDaddy has more acquisitions in the pipeline, but the company is likely to require additional expertise if it aims to become a one-stop shop for WordPress professionals. GoDaddy is part of a more recent trend of hosting companies acquiring WordPress products and services, including its <a href="https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-wordpress-site-management-service-managewp" target="_blank">ManageWP acquisition</a> and <a href="https://wptavern.com/flywheel-acquires-wordpress-local-development-tool-pressmatic" target="_blank">Flywheel&#8217;s purchase of Pressmatic</a>. The trend has sparked some recent discussion on Twitter regarding &#8220;hosting companies eating WordPress:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If software is eating the world, then hosting companies are eating WordPress.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Cory Miller (@corymiller303) <a href="https://twitter.com/corymiller303/status/805891418866806784">December 5, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mays sees this notion as a positive development and an opportunity for hosts to become more deeply invested in WordPress core and the surrounding ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We see it as win-win for hosts and the WordPress community, more investment in WordPress is better for everyone,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;For example, this year we hired our first core contributor, contributed full translations to some of the most popular themes and plugins, built a number of themes and plugins and contributed them to the WordPress repo and more.

Sucuri is a website security platform that helps clean and protect websites. I would consider us a small mid-sized company. Our annual sponsorship budget is in the range of $300 &#8211; $400k per calendar year (CY).</p>\n<p>One of the industry events we’ve been actively participating in since our inception has been WordCamps. Unlike 2015, in 2016 I decided to be more pragmatic in the way we invest in WordCamps. This new approach stemmed from two basic questions &#8211; <b>What is the ROI of sponsoring a WordCamp and should a business sponsor a WordCamp?</b></p>\n<p>One qualifier I want to add before getting started is that tracking success at events is very difficult. Even with the number of tools and approaches in the market, many organizations struggle getting their hands around the actual ROI of any event sponsorship. This means that many of the points in this post are not unique to the WordPress ecosystem, but the uniqueness and openness of the community makes it worth discussing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Reality of WordCamps and Sponsors</h1>\n<p>It’s been many years since I helped co-organize a WordCamp (<a href="https://2011.sandiego.wordcamp.org/">San Diego back in 2011</a>), and there is no denying that a lot has changed in the way they are put together. The one thing that hasn’t changed however, is the struggle organizers face when it comes to fundraising. Over the years we’ve seen a number of awesome initiatives by the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a> to help assist in the process.</p>\n<p>At <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US 2016</a>, <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">the State of Word reported </a>that in 2016 alone there were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>116 WordCamps around the world</li>\n<li>36,000 attendees</li>\n<li>2,056 speakers</li>\n<li>1,036 sponsors</li>\n<li>750 organizers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What makes it even more impressive is that these are events put on by volunteers. Matt Mullenweg also shared that these WordCamps are made possible by the generosity of the various sponsors which cover 85 &#8211; 95% of the costs associated with such events.</p>\n<p>It’s because of these sponsors that the costs are kept so low for attendees; including the annual event (WCUS) which came in at a cost greater than $500 per person but sold for ~$20 / day (Total of $40 / person). This is truly a herculean feat, and I commend them on their success to date.</p>\n<h1>The Sponsor Canoe Is Leaking</h1>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Canoes.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64321" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Canoes.png?resize=705%2C210&ssl=1" alt="Canoes" /></a>photo credit: dolbinator1000 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/126654539@N08/25305151246">Boyhood</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>With this in mind, I think it’s fair to say that at the rate things are going we might find ourselves with a problem of scale. While there have been 1k + sponsors in 2016, I would wager that a majority of the money is likely coming from a smaller subset of that group.</p>\n<p>Taking this into consideration, unless you’re Automattic, I can’t help but imagine that as a business the ROI question continues to come up as it does for me. This is further compounded by the dramatic increase in the <strong>a)</strong> request for sponsorships (# of camps) and <strong>b)</strong> the economics of the sponsorship itself (the $$ amount).</p>\n<p>This makes me think that it’s only a matter of time when the source of funds will be exhausted. Organizations have fiduciary responsibilities to their companies to spend their cash flow wisely, especially in today’s turbulent economic times.</p>\n<p>The impacts of this, as highlighted above, are going to be felt (if not already) by those volunteers trying to put on these great WordCamps. This will become exceptionally difficult for new camps, especially those in remote cities and countries.</p>\n<h1>Why Do Businesses Sponsor WordCamps?</h1>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QuestionmarkSmaller.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-48305" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QuestionmarkSmaller.png?resize=650%2C200&ssl=1" alt="Smaller Question mark featured image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthewmcvickar/4380126801/">Matthew McVickar</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>There is one common phrase every business that has invested in WordCamps has come to terms with &#8211; <b>sponsorships are done in-kind; expect nothing</b>.<i> I’m not clear how this guidance came to be, whether it was explicitly outlined by the Foundation or guidance that came to be over time. What I do know is that a good number of sponsors are familiar with it. </i></p>\n<p>Whether intended or not, allow me to be the first to publicly admit that while we are familiar with the phrase, no one really subscribes to it. The dirty little secret is that every business has some form of an expected ROI. It’s not always financially based, but there is some expectation. Companies sponsor events because there is some vested interest unless we’re talking about a child’s gymnastics or softball team.</p>\n<p>ROI takes many different shapes. Allow me to share the ROI as I see it when I look across the spectrum of some of today’s top sponsors (know that these are all my opinions as a third-party observer):</p>\n<h3><b>GoDaddy </b></h3>\n<p>They sponsor because they need to. When they came into the space two to three years ago, after the changing of the guard they identified the potential in WordPress. They had an image problem; one that couldn’t be fixed remotely. It had to be fixed with boots on the ground.</p>\n<p>Building relationships. Sharing experiences. Engaging influencers (do not underestimate the power of influencers). Whatever you might think of the brand today is nothing compared to what it was a few years ago. WordCamps have been a critical piece of their strategy to make this work. Who doesn’t know <a href="https://ifyouwillit.com/about-mendel-kurland/">Mendel Kurland</a>?</p>\n<h3><b>SiteGround </b></h3>\n<p>When they started to make their big push into the market, they were at every camp giving away free accounts. For them, it wasn’t about the short-term gain as much as the long-term gain. They had everything going against them. They were from Bulgaria working to service the biggest economic market, the US. They were trying to penetrate what many would argue was an already saturated market.</p>\n<p>I remember when they first appeared. No one knew them, and yet through their guerrilla marketing tactics, brand ambassadorship, stellar performance with customers, and word-of-mouth referrals, they are a powerhouse in the WP hosting space.</p>\n<h3><b>WP Engine</b></h3>\n<p>While they exploded through a number of initiatives, I believe that WordCamps and their strategy to engage with the community is what propelled them ahead of their competitors. Their focus wasn’t revenue generation early on. I recall their free accounts campaign. I think it ran for close to two years.</p>\n<p>What better combination than to have a freemium-like model where all you have to do is focus on user adoption (oversimplification of course). Your product and support are spot on, you just need more people touching it, more people telling their friends about it. They grew organically and these events made that possible.</p>\n<h3><b>Automattic</b></h3>\n<p>Honestly, they have no choice but to sponsor. They are the project sponsor by design. They are in many ways tied to the success and continued growth of the platform. They too have their free services that require adoption and user growth, things like Jetpack, Akismet, WooCommerce, and so many others.</p>\n<p>Without growth, they are dead solutions. They have to show support for a product that they’ve gone all in on. If they don’t sponsor, why would anyone else? Their fates are intertwined.</p>\n<p>And the observations go on. Granted, these are obvious gross oversimplifications, but I share them to highlight what ROI can look like. I also share them to show you what success looks like, and what the DNA of these organizations look like. Most of the scenarios above are built on the idea of “free” or “free-ish” services, with the exception being GoDaddy whose prices are so low you might as well consider them a freemium-like model.</p>\n<h1>Measuring the ROI of Events</h1>\n<p>What happens if you’re a premium service though? In this scenario, your ROI is no longer about adoption or user growth. Instead you’re now focused on growth in the form of revenue and sales. User adoption will never be as great as the freemium model.</p>\n<p>As organizations, we’ve invested a lot of money. There has to be something we’re getting out of this. Only in the WordCamp community have I seen this idea that people will donate not only time, but money, under the assumption that there will be nothing at the end of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>I wanted to better understand this myself, and what better place to look for ROI than our own data here at Sucuri.</p>\n<p>The data below highlights the period between December 2015 &#8211; June 2016. I encourage other businesses to share their own data to add to the conversation. When speaking to ROI, I looked for measurable attributes first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many marketing leads were captured?</li>\n<li>How many sales leads were captured?</li>\n<li>How many of those leads converted to sales?</li>\n<li>What kind of exposure did we get via social?</li>\n<li>What kind of exposure did we get via backlinks?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest immeasurable metric being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What kind of brand awareness are you really getting?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the table below, <b>sponsorship</b> is exactly what you’d think, while <b>financial investment</b> implies ancillary costs of getting people there, lodging and eating. It does not include labor, collateral, shipping and other items.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucurisWordCampsInvestments.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64325" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucurisWordCampsInvestments.png?resize=996%2C265&ssl=1" alt="Sucuri WordCamp Investments Dec. 2015 - June 2016" /></a>Sucuri&#8217;s WordCamp Investments Dec. 2015 &#8211; June 2016\n<p>This chart shows the ROI we got in terms of money (did we close deals?) As a for-profit business one of the many attributes we look at are the total net-new customers we can generate from any investment, including events.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriCPLCACInvestment.png?ssl=1"><img class="wp-image-64327 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriCPLCACInvestment.png?resize=887%2C259&ssl=1" alt="Sucuri Investment CPL/CAC Analysis" /></a>Sucuri Investment CPL/CAC Analysis\n<p>To date, from all the events including WordCamp US (2015), we were able to track a total of 13 deals that closed from a direct engagement at the event. Putting the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) in the neighborhood of $12.4k per closed lead.</p>\n<p>This means that my lifetime value (LTV), if they purchased a basic plan at $199.99 would have to be 45 years. If they purchased our $499.99 plan, we&#8217;d be looking at a 18 year LTV.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriInvestmentMeasurableROI.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64328" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriInvestmentMeasurableROI.png?resize=1006%2C165&ssl=1" alt="Sucuri Investment Measurable ROI" /></a>Sucuri Investment Measurable ROI\n<p>Focusing on exposure, it is one of the many things you get from sponsoring an event. You get linkbacks from the event, shout outs on the pages, posts highlighting your sponsorship. What does that really amount to? Can it be measured? The easiest way to answer these questions was to look at the main site links and social engagements.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriWebSocialImpact.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64329" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriWebSocialImpact.png?resize=577%2C304&ssl=1" alt="Sucuri Web / Social Sponsorship Impact" /></a>Sucuri Web / Social Sponsorship Impact\n<p>We generated 190 sessions total, the most coming from WordCamp US (at the time of the event, not leading up to it, or after). We generate over 500k sessions a month across all our platforms. This makes 190 total sessions over a six month period negligible.</p>\n<p>In my review, we looked at direct traffic from referrals and traced down the social <b>&#8220;thank you&#8221;</b> and <b>&#8220;promotions&#8221;</b> each event provided. It&#8217;s fair to note, that the lack of success in the measurable values above could be very closely be related to our ineffectiveness as an organization as well. We could just be really bad at working events; it’s an art in and of itself.</p>\n<p>I intentionally did not include marketing leads. For me, my focus is looking at what actually converts so when we go to events, we place more emphasis on qualified sales leads (opportunities) than marketing leads; I am not very big on getting into the card collection and SPAM business.</p>\n<p><b>What does this all mean?</b></p>\n<p>Well, if I was a rational person this would mean that as a premium service provider, investing in WordCamps doesn’t make sense. Trust me, I love the community. We are involved in many ways, but this is really too difficult to digest and justify. I wonder what happens when more companies, even the ones that I shared above, start doing the same mathematics.</p>\n<h1>The WordCamp Sponsorship Conundrum</h1>\n<p>The WordPress platform promotes the idea of Free and targets a very curious niche of people &#8211; self-service/Do It Yourself (DIY) types. By this self-proclaimed profile, they are not buyers of premium services; they are the ones that will invest sweat equity to build or find an alternative to their problem &#8211; <b>it just has to be free. </b></p>\n<p>This ideology is fine, but it also means that it frankly may not be the right market for most premium businesses. I would be remiss however, if I did not highlight the fact that a number of the sponsors for WCUS 2016 were premium service providers. The only challenge I would make to this claim is that just because they are sponsoring, doesn’t mean they are getting a return.</p>\n<p>I’d also challenge it and say some of them have a need to sponsor for some of the same reasons described above. Just because a premium service sponsors, it doesn’t mean their goal is defined purely around selling, in many instances it’s built around brand awareness and ambassadorship &#8211; especially unknown brands, or those with bad reputations. GoDaddy is a perfect example of this.</p>\n<p>Does this mean that there is no hope? No, I don’t think so. I just think we have to ask ourselves some key questions, both as organizations and a community. To assist in the conversation, I’ve highlighted a few areas that I find challenging as a business and encourage others to introduce their own. If nothing else, this can help both the Foundation and organizers alike better work with sponsors.</p>\n<h2>The Audience Quality Factor</h2>\n<p>When we turn our attention to WordCamps, events designed to promote and bring together these ideals, you realize that the problem with WordCamps for businesses is the audience.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m by no way saying that their current design is bad for what WordCamps were designed for. On the contrary, I&#8217;d say they&#8217;ve done an exceptional job sticking to their predefined audience, at least in terms of cost bracket. They don’t, however, do a good job of differentiating between the various personas in attendance. They’re all rolled up into one big bucket. This creates a severe imbalance between the economic investment and audience potential.</p>\n<p>This imbalance I think has to do with the quality of the audience. This is not meant to imply that the audience is not good in their own right, but from a company perspective not so much (i.e., as a potential customer). In a world where everything is expected to be free, and quickly commoditized, how do you bridge that divide?</p>\n<p>This also has residual effects as well into the quality that can be expected at the event, in terms of organization, presentation and speakers. There are so many different ways this can go, does it mean WordCamp Pro like events? I’m not sure, but what I do know is that in it’s current incarnation something has to give.</p>\n<p>Granted, this does not apply to everyone. I know a number of theme shops that bring and meet their customers at these events. Where closing one deal cannot only cover their costs, but set them up nicely for a couple of months.  My points here are more tailored at product / premium shops that are operating at a very different scale and configuration.</p>\n<h2>Increasing Number of Events Globally</h2>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPWorldLogo.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6948" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPWorldLogo.jpg?resize=200%2C160&ssl=1" alt="WordPress World" /></a>The sheer volume of camps and sponsorships presents a very big problem, not just for the Foundation but for businesses as well. Which ones do you invest in? Which will offer the most return?</p>\n<p>I assure you, these are the conversations that are occurring. There are so many, and it’s impossible to invest in them all (at least in a meaningful way). This will continue to put undue pressures on all the organizing teams looking to raise funds. I think you can see an example of this with this years WCUS 2016 sponsorships, a very different (stark) representation of today’s reality when it comes to sponsorships.</p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m very familiar with the new Global Sponsorship opportunities the Foundation has put together. They&#8217;re divided by geographic region, and don&#8217;t include the main geographic events like WordCamp US and WordCamp Europe. The prices are below:</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GlobalSponsorshipOpportunities.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64326" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GlobalSponsorshipOpportunities.png?resize=730%2C143&ssl=1" alt="Global Sponsorship Prices" /></a>Global Sponsorship Prices\n<p>It’s definitely a great idea, but providing a large sum of cash that gets distributed across events that you may or may not attend isn’t something I’m particularly fond of. I worry about the longevity of this program, and while I know there are always new sponsors, what will the churn look like in the program. Only time will tell.</p>\n<h2>Impacts of a Corporation Type</h2>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, the entity responsible for facilitating the growth and management of WordCamps around the world is now known as the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/03/02/transitioning-to-wordpress-community-support/">“WordPress Community Support (WPCS) Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)”</a>. This new entity is a subsidiary of the WordPress Foundation, which is still a non-profit, and established in 2016 (Yes, Matt said it’d take effect in 2017 but I’m pretty sure that was in error).</p>\n<blockquote><p>After March 31, sponsorship payments sent to WordPress Foundation accounts will be returned to sender. Please send <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/budget-and-finances/running-the-money-through-wpcs/#sponsorship-revenue">revised payment instructions</a> to any sponsors who have not yet paid.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This new entity is what is known as a benefit corporation, and should NOT be confused with a b-corp. Although it is used in many instances interchangeably, there are a number of differentiating factors, the biggest being that to obtain a b-corp classification an entity must be certified.</p>\n<blockquote><p>B Corps are for-profit companies certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Establishing a PBC to handle the WordCamps I firmly believe was done with the best of intentions for the community, but it does present a few challenges for private businesses. A PBC is still a private for-profit company. The biggest difference, however, is that unlike other corporation types (e.g., C, S, etc..) a PBC allows an organization to be a charter (or mission focused) in addition to more traditional goals of generating profits for its shareholders.</p>\n<p>This change is a bit more significant than might be implied when reading through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/03/02/transitioning-to-wordpress-community-support/">the announcement</a>. One of the driving forces for the change was to make the sponsorship process easier for both the organizers and sponsors alike:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the main advantages to the change from the WordPress Foundation (a non-profit) to the WPCS (a public benefit corporation) is that the rules around sponsoring official WordPress events are much simpler.</p>\n<p>The people involved in overseeing the program have updated sponsor rules accordingly, to eliminate the barriers to value-adding stuff like direct links, discounts, and calls to action, while keeping the ones that helped us form such a trustworthy, community-focused sponsor program, like the rule about not using superlatives or unprovable claims.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a prior WordCamp organizer, there is perhaps no greater challenge in my mind than asking people for money. While my experience was back in 2011, I can only imagine that the struggles are still the same and one of the things leveraged when pitching to companies are the benefits of a non-profit. The non-profit classification was not just about securing donations like venues (which is very important) but it’s critical for some in securing the dollars they require.</p>\n<p>For a company, it also makes it harder to justify the costs. As the dollar investment continues to increase, the one thing that could always be counted on was the non-profit status. By changing it to a private organization (on paper) it’s donating money to another company (regardless of what the mission may or may not be). This might not be a big deal for some, but when we start talking significant investments, it becomes a serious problem.</p>\n<h1>Incentivizing Businesses</h1>\n<p>When you read through the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/fundraising/wordcamp-sponsorship/#wordcamp-sponsorship-rules-for-2016">Sponsorship rules for 2016</a> the changes are not incentivizing enough for a business. The biggest change being the ability to print comparisons or introduce pricing on collateral, both of which are insignificant as you can account for most of your physical collateral to end up in the trash and difficult to track.</p>\n<p>I believe there will be, or are changes in the works, to include pricing on virtual print as well which will definitely be a positive move, but I defer to the ROI measurements above as well.</p>\n<p>While the idea of incentivizing a business might be repulsive, it’s a necessity. As a good friend of mine mentioned, it’s about exposure for businesses. If we’re investing significant dollars and being such pivotal players in the success of these events, then we’re going to ask for as much exposure as possible.</p>\n<p>We’re also going to push the limits of our imaginations and require some flexibility, in return I think most companies would willingly be open to negotiation and flexibility. If ROI is going to be based on exposure and brand awareness, we need to be able to capitalize on that.</p>\n<p>What might be interesting here is to perhaps do a survey of businesses, those that have been supporting the WordCamp communities for years, and take a poll. Maybe present some options and make them part of the process. Even if it’s a fixed list, maybe ask for a wishlist of things; things that can be discussed and openly taken into consideration.</p>\n<p>Like I tell my teams &#8211;<b>most reasonable people don’t need to always win, they just want to be heard and be part of the process.</b> This applies to companies as well. When it comes down to it, it’s but a few people at each organization that will be your evangelists.</p>\n<h1>WordCamp Sponsorship Can Work</h1>\n<p>I am not saying that sponsoring WordCamps is not valuable. I’m also not saying that it’s a lost cause working with WordCamps.  I am saying that it’s important to have a dialog if longevity is what we’re after in the community,  sponsorships are the bloodline that keep these events going.</p>\n<p>There is little that can be done about the growth of events or the new subsidiary (and I don’t think either is bad). They are today’s realities and as organizations we’ll have to work through them independently.</p>\n<p>The two areas I think can be improved on is the audience and how businesses are incentivized.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m not particularly hopeful of the audience, that’s a problem the community will need to solve and not necessarily something the Foundation should concern themselves with. If I were the Foundation, I would be doing exactly what they are doing &#8211;<b> keep the price as low as possible to make it reachable to everyone (need a low barrier to entry). </b>We’ve already seen a few events attempt this, and the best example in my opinion so far has been <a href="https://wooconf.com/">WooConf</a> and <a href="https://wpcampus.org/">WPCampus</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The one I’m more hopeful of is how businesses are incentivized. If we can agree that at a minimum all organizations are looking for exposure, then that should be the easiest place to start. A few examples might include: speaking guarantees, more prominent branding, access to some form of audience information. Yes, some of these are highly controversial, but I have faith that together we can make something work that is in line with the spirit of these events. I would also encourage other camps to look at <a href="https://2017.miami.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Miami</a>; beyond  having a Learn JavaScript Deeply track, they do an exceptional job with the way they engage with their sponsors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I share this post as a way to provide a perspective that I hope is unique and valuable. If it starts a discussion, and opens a better dialog between businesses, WordCamp organizers and the Foundation then I will consider it a success. Sponsors are a critical piece to the continued success and growth of these community events, and I’d like to ensure that continues.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Dec 2016 04:36:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.7.3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://buddypress.org/?p=261855";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"https://buddypress.org/2016/12/buddypress-2-7-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:756:"<p>BuddyPress 2.7.3 is now available.

For the first time, WordPress is 100% translated into Urdu, the national language of Pakistan. Urdu is spoken by 100 million people in several different areas of the world, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>As part of the effort to bring the Urdu translation to 100%, WordPress developer Ahmad Awais <a href="https://ahmadawais.com/urdu-wordpress/" target="_blank">organized a small meetup in Lahore, Pakistan</a> during the <a href="https://wptavern.com/2nd-global-wordpress-translation-day-brings-780-translators-together-across-133-locales" target="_blank">2nd WP Translation Day</a> event. More than 60 attendees joined online and offline over the span of two days with many participating in the <a href="http://WP-Pakistan.Slack.com" target="_blank">WP-Pakistan Slack</a> team in the #translators channel.</p>\n<p>Having WordPress available in Urdu is a major milestone for the Pakistani tech community. It makes it possible for government websites to adopt the software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The government websites are required to be accessible,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;While we are not there yet, there are efforts underway to make every government website available in both English and Urdu.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awais cited the <a href="https://www.nadra.gov.pk/" target="_blank">National Database and Registration Authority</a> (NADRA) website as one example that has recently started using WordPress for its online portal. NADRA issues identity cards with CNIC numbers in Pakistan, similar to social security numbers in the US.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nadra-website.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nadra-website.png?resize=1025%2C720&ssl=1" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64303" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The NADRA site is far from perfect but is much better than other government sites,&#8221; Aawais said. &#8220;People have already started to notice that. There&#8217;s a pretty large developer community in Pakistan that&#8217;s connected to WordPress in one way or another, but on the consumer end &#8211; not so much.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awais said many Pakistani media sites are powered by WordPress but adoption is slower when it comes to e-commerce. WordPress penetration in the enterprise sector is nearly non-existent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the 100% Urdu variant of WordPress will definitely help in the expansion for the local consumer-base,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;Web developers will find it easier to pitch WordPress as the go-to CMS for government, local, and higher education web properties as compared to other proprietary, closed-source Urdu CMS software. That alone can have a huge impact as far as the growth of the local WordPress community is concerned.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The concept of contributing back to open source software is still relatively new in Pakistan but Awais and his fellow translators and developers are working to change the general perception in their tech culture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would like to request Foundation to pay more attention to regions like ours, where software developers, computer science students, and entrepreneurs seldom understand the concept of open source software,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;The concept of giving back and making it work to pay the bills is lost on simple and misunderstood questions of &#8216;Can people make money via Open Source?&#8217; and &#8216;What do you get by giving back and helping out for free?&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Believe me, these are tough questions to be answered when there are no huge WordPress supported companies picking up the tabs for those who are trying to give back,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;Support for open source is a rare commodity here. I hope that changes in the next five years or so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle" target="_blank">2016 State of the Word</a>, Matt Mullenweg said one of <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805158678353608704" target="_blank">the Foundation&#8217;s new focuses</a> will be running educational workshops in developing nations. When asked about how this initiative will work during the Q&amp;A session, Mullenweg said they are still figuring it out but envision an open source curriculum with locally run classes and support.</p>\n<p>More than 100 translators participated in bringing the Urdu translation to 100% for WordPress. With the software now accessible to 100 million Urdu speakers, the region seems like a good candidate for an educational investment to bring more developers up to speed with using WordPress for commerce and government sites.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 07 Dec 2016 20:56:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"HeroPress: Full Circle: Life Lessons of a Perennial Entrepreneur";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1517";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://heropress.com/essays/full-circle-life-lessons-perennial-entrepreneur/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10454:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/120716-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: Take the time to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. You''ll be glad you did." /><p>I didn’t go to college until I was in my 40’s. When I graduated high school I went to work for a family business.</p>\n<p>There has been one common thread throughout my adult career, my love for technology.</p>\n<p>I was 24 when I bought my first computer, it was PC running MS-DOS.</p>\n<p>Five years later, the company I was working for bought a computer program to manage their rental properties. I was responsible for using it and data entry. The program was written by a local software developer. He became a mentor and when problems arose with the code, he walked me through on the phone how to edit and compile the source code. (Yes, he left a copy of the source code on the computer &#8211; this was way before remote support was possible.) It was dBase II. Fast forward a few years later and he hired me as a part-time contractor to help him customize the codebase for his clients. It seemed I had a knack for writing code and troubleshooting bugs.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I would go on to purchase the source code from him and launch my own property management software company. I ran it for eight years, while I rewrote the entire codebase. My business grew. I learned a lot about sales, running a business and managing employees. Most importantly, I learned how to listen to clients and by doing so, I was able to create the products they needed to run their businesses.</p>\n<p>Then, Windows came onto the scene. My software was not Windows compatible. It was running on FoxPro, a Dbase III competitor for MS-DOS. My business plateaued and I was faced with another rewrite of the codebase to stay competitive. To top it off, I’d lost my only support person at the same time. These are the challenges most small business owners face at some point. I was experiencing burnout and needed a change. Long story short, I eventually sold the software line to a competitor who was looking to expand their user base and incorporates some features that were in demand that my product had. It was win-win for both of us and to this day &#8211; I&#8217;m still happy about that transaction.</p>\n<p>I went on to work at a boutique consulting services firm in Houston, Texas as an Account Manager to large Fortune 500 clients, mostly in the energy sector. It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot about working in the enterprise space. This was very different from working with the small property management companies I had previously serviced. It was a great four years. The last year boomed as many clients scrambled to complete their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K upgrades</a>.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2000, everything changed. The company had been acquired, and the dot-com bubble had burst. All the Y2K work was done and the world did not end. I decided to take some time off.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2000, I enrolled at a local community college. I spent the next two years and half years completing my core curriculum and then transferred to Texas A&amp;M in 2003 to complete a Bachelor of Science degree in Horticulture.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Horticulture?</strong> I’ve always loved gardening and jumped at the opportunity to learn everything I could about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Life Lesson:</strong> In hindsight &#8211; I wish I would have completed a degree in Computer Science. It was a bit of my own arrogance, that since I had run a software company and worked at a consulting firm, I knew all I needed to know. Truth was, I didn’t and would have benefited greatly from that experience.</p>\n<h3>Trying to make a hobby into a business.</h3>\n<p>In 2003, I decided to open an online store to sell home and garden gifts. I built a website using the Yahoo Store platform, and for the next 5 years watched it grow.</p>\n<p>My first introduction to WordPress came when I wanted to start a blog for the store. I like the idea of a self-hosted solution and loved getting back into programming.</p>\n<p>I went from running the business from my home to a small warehouse. It was 2007 and the housing market was booming. I jumped at the opportunity to lease a much larger warehouse with a retail storefront.</p>\n<p>There were important life lessons in it. One that made a strong impression on me was best described by the character Justin Matisse in the movie Hope Floats:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout the American Dream. You find something that you love, and then you twist it, and you torture it, try and find a way to make money at it. You spend a lifetime doing that. At the end, you can&#8217;t find a trace of what you started out lovin&#8217;. &#8220;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That’s how I felt sometimes when running my store. What I loved about the home and garden space and trying to make money at it were sometimes at odds with each other. I loved designing the website, adding functionality and mastering the art of improving the SEO of the site.</p>\n<p>I was about to learn a very painful and valuable lesson. I was financing the growth with debt. I got caught up in the growth curve and was sure that things would just keep getting better, allowing me to pay down the debt. Indeed servicing the debt was not a problem, as sales continued to grow.</p>\n<p>Then came 2008 and the Great Recession. For the next three years, I watched sales decline, my credit lines pulled and my business contract. That made servicing the debt, really hard. I was stuck in a lease that I could not afford. Many of the vendors I bought products from went out of business. Everyone was hurting. <strong>I was not financially prepared for it.</strong></p>\n<p>In the end, a chain of events led to a huge financial mess &#8211; one that to this day, I am still recovering from. In 2011, I liquidated the inventory, sold my online store to a third-party and moved on.</p>\n<h3>Transitioning to WordPress</h3>\n<p>I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do at that point. I was depressed and dealing with the financial fallout of losing my business.</p>\n<p>I wrote content for a garden center and slowly began working on websites for others. I chose to use the Genesis Framework and began customizing their themes for clients. I liked it because it leveraged the power of hooks and filters in a way that made sense to me &#8211; and the Genesis community is amazing.</p>\n<p>I worked in real estate for a while to help pay the bills, but it just wasn’t right for me.</p>\n<p>During this transition period, I used the time to improve my web development skills. I began working with WordPress every day, learning everything I could. I took online courses in HTML, CSS and PHP.</p>\n<p>Today, I’m running my own business again, building websites and helping clients promote their digital brand. I learned a lot about SEO running my eCommerce business, how to market products, write copy and promote my brand. Now I’m helping clients do that.</p>\n<p>With decades of business experience along with some hard life lessons, here’s what I’ve learned so far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t assume things will continue in the same direction. Business is cyclical, so like a squirrel &#8211; stash away some nuts for the winter.</li>\n<li>Stay out of debt.</li>\n<li>Know when to hold &#8217;em and when to fold &#8217;em. Sometimes hindsight helps make this clearer, but trust your gut and follow your instincts.</li>\n<li>Be helpful to others.

On the night before WordCamp US took place, <a href="https://pantheon.io/">Pantheon&#8217;s</a> sponsorship was revoked and advertising materials, including the company&#8217;s booth, were hidden in a storage room inside the venue. The move generated a <a href="https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber/status/804721149900890112">lot of controversy</a> on social media and at the event. It cost Pantheon $100K to sponsor WordCamp US, but the company received a refund.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our booth disappeared but the team''s still here!

The Sheraton <a href="http://www.sheratonphiladelphiadowntown.com/philadelphia-meetings">hosts a number of meetings</a> and has a couple of different advertising packages available. Stodolnic purchased advertising space on the hotel&#8217;s elevators. The advertising material was simple and didn&#8217;t make unprovable claims, such as the world&#8217;s best or fastest host. This is in line with the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/fundraising/wordcamp-sponsorship/#wordcamp-sponsorship-rules-for-2016">sponsorship rules</a>.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PantheonElevatorAdvertising.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64262" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PantheonElevatorAdvertising.png?resize=629%2C806&ssl=1" alt="Pantheon''s Elevator Advertising" /></a>Pantheon&#8217;s Elevator Advertising\n<p>On December 1st late at night, Stodolnic received an email from WCUS organizers requesting that the advertising material be removed. Stodolnic pushed back as the sponsorship agreement does not specifically prohibit advertising in the hotel. At one point during the exchange of emails, the WCUS organizing team threatened to take the banners down themselves. Stodolnic responded with anger as the purchase had already been made but he quickly apologized.</p>\n<p>The issue was eventually escalated to Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of the WordPress open source software project, who revoked the company&#8217;s sponsorship of the event for violating the code of conduct. Later that night, WCUS organizers deconstructed Pantheon&#8217;s booth and moved it to a storage room along with 600 T-shirts printed by the company.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PantheonsBoothBefore.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64259" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PantheonsBoothBefore.png?resize=981%2C734&ssl=1" alt="Pantheon''s Booth at WCUS Before Being Taken Down" /></a>Pantheon&#8217;s Booth at WCUS Before Being Taken Down\n<p>Day one of WordCamp US went off without a hitch but it was slightly overshadowed by the sudden removal of Pantheon. A few Pantheon employees published unfavorable messages on Twitter about the situation. Those tweets have since been deleted. At the conclusion of day two, Cami Kaos, one of the lead organizers of WordCamp US, published a post on the <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/">event&#8217;s blog</a> highlighting what happened.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SponsorUpdatePost.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64261" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SponsorUpdatePost.png?resize=1004%2C739&ssl=1" alt="Archived Image of The Post Published on the WCUS Blog Explaining The Situation" /></a>Archived Image of The Post Published on the WCUS Blog Explaining The Situation\n<p>The post doesn&#8217;t specifically name Pantheon and says the sponsor in question violated the event&#8217;s <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>. I spoke to a number of Pantheon employees who read the post and couldn&#8217;t identify the violation in question. Within hours of being published, the post was removed from the site without an explanation.</p>\n<h2>Cooler Heads Prevail</h2>\n<p>During day two of WCUS, Stodolnic and Pantheon Co-founder Josh Koenig, spoke to Mullenweg face-to-face in a closed-door meeting at the venue. What was said is unknown but when I asked Mullenweg what the result of the meeting was, he said, &#8220;I think we&#8217;re in a much better place.&#8221; He also didn&#8217;t comment when asked how Pantheon violated the code of conduct.</p>\n<p>After the meeting, Stodolnic told me that both sides agreed that communication could have been handled better and that cooler heads prevailed. Mullenweg wouldn&#8217;t comment when asked whether Pantheon was banned from sponsoring WordCamps in 2017.</p>\n<p>We now know that the official hotel for WordCamp US is an extension of the venue allowing organizers to enforce the code of conduct and sponsorship and principles agreements. It&#8217;s likely that due to this incident, the sponsorship agreement will be amended to specifically prohibit advertising in the official hotel at next year&#8217;s event.</p>\n<p>Pantheon is a six-year old company making inroads in the managed WordPress hosting space. Not being able to sponsor WordCamps in 2017, <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2016/03/28/pantheon-joins-the-wordpress-global-community-sponsorship-program-in-2016/">as they did in 2016,</a> could derail their momentum in building brand awareness.</p>\n<h2>Is It Worth It to Sponsor WordCamps?</h2>\n<p>Many of the sponsors I spoke to at WordCamp US described what Pantheon did as genius and were disappointed that they didn&#8217;t think of it first. This opens the door to a wider conversation. Is it financially worth it to sponsor WordCamps and are there enough opportunities to see a return on investment?</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Tony Perez, <span class="st">CEO of Sucuri, started a <a href="https://twitter.com/perezbox/status/749283708209799168">passionate discussion</a> on Twitter around the value of sponsoring WordCamps. As the costs of sponsoring and the number of WordCamps increases, businesses will need to be more selective of which camps they sponsor.<br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordcamp?src=hash">#wordcamp</a> sponsorships and today''s businesses will be coming to a cross roads in the the not so distant future.. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordpress?src=hash">#wordpress</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Tony Perez (@perezbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/perezbox/status/749283708209799168">July 2, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">major announcements at WordCamp US</a> is that WordCamps will now run finances through a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/budget-and-finances/running-the-money-through-wpcs/">Public Benefit Corporation</a>. Previously, finances were run through the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a>, a 501(c) non-profit entity which <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/03/02/transitioning-to-wordpress-community-support/">severely limited</a> what sponsors were able to do at events due to IRS regulations.

This release makes significant improvements to the new theme setup experience, inspiring the tagline: &#8220;Your site, your way.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-default-theme-twenty-seventeen-merged-into-4-7" target="_blank">Twenty Seventeen is making its debut in 4.7</a> as the first default theme designed for business websites. It beautifully showcases new features for theme developers and demonstrates many improvements to the setup process. Twenty Seventeen offers four customizable panels on the front page for displaying existing content, custom logo upload, fullscreen featured images, and brand new core support for video headers.</p>\n<div class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(''video'');</script><![endif]--><br />\n<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2016/10/panels-ui-small.mp4">https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2016/10/panels-ui-small.mp4</a></div>\n<h3>Starter Content and Edit Shortcuts</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 gives theme developers the ability to provide <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/30/starter-content-for-themes-in-4-7/" target="_blank">starter content</a>, such as a business info widget or a sample social icons menu. The content serves as a placeholder but doesn&#8217;t appear on the live site until the user has customized and published it.</p>\n<p>New <a href="https://wptavern.com/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-wordpress-4-7-makes-customizing-sites-easier" target="_blank">visible edit shortcuts</a> display a pencil icon on areas of a theme that can be customized. Clicking the icons will automatically open the correct panel for the setting, which saves users time that might otherwise have been spent hunting around for the right setting to adjust. Theme authors will need to add theme support as well as support for selective refresh in order to take advantage of this new feature.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?resize=1025%2C544&ssl=1" alt="Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons" class="size-full wp-image-63883" /></a>Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons\n<p>The new starter content and edit shortcuts features, especially when combined, give theme authors the ability to make customization easier and faster for their users. Themes with dozens of customizer options that may have previously seemed complicated to set up may now be more approachable.</p>\n<h3>Improved Menu Building and Custom CSS with Live Previews</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 <a href="https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-feature-proposal-adds-content-authorship-to-menus-in-the-customizer" target="_blank">adds content authorship to menus in the Customizer</a>. Users can now create new pages while setting up menus, without having to navigate back to the admin. This makes for a smoother workflow when setting up a brand new site.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/a-preview-of-the-custom-css-editor-added-to-the-customizer-in-wordpress-4-7" target="_blank">Custom CSS with live previews</a> is also new in this release. Users can now tweak the appearance of themes and plugins and see the results instantly. Those who have been using Jetpack&#8217;s Custom CSS module should have a seamless migration. The new feature is fairly basic but extensible so <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/26/extending-the-custom-css-editor/" target="_blank">plugin developers can add additional functionality</a> on top of it.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WP47CustomizerCSSEditor.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WP47CustomizerCSSEditor.png?resize=1025%2C394&ssl=1" alt="CSS Editor in The WordPress 4.7 Customizer" class="size-full wp-image-63483" /></a>CSS Editor in The WordPress 4.7 Customizer\n<p>WordPress 4.7 is packed full of many other user-facing improvements that make managing and editing content easier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PDF thumbnail previews for better document management</li>\n<li>User admin languages</li>\n<li>Media library is now searchable by file name</li>\n<li>Improved Custom Background Properties UI (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22058" target="_blank">#22058</a>)</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/28/editor-changes-in-4-7/" target="_blank">Editor changes</a>: easier access to most-used buttons, improved discovery for keyboard shortcuts in tooltips and dropdowns</li>\n<li>Customizer sliding panels UI is now faster, smoother, and more accessible</li>\n<li>oEmbed support for Facebook posts/activities/photo/videos/media/questions/notes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WP REST API Content Endpoints Added to 4.7</h3>\n<p>One of the most exciting improvements to WordPress for developers is the addition of the <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-officially-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-7" target="_blank">WP REST API content endpoints</a> for posts, comments, terms, users, meta, and settings. This API opens up new ways of accessing and presenting WordPress content in themes, plugins, and applications &#8211; both inside and outside of the traditional WordPress interface. The WP REST API now has an <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/" target="_blank">official reference for documentation</a> on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>A few highlights of additional improvements for developers include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-brings-custom-page-template-functionality-to-all-post-types" target="_blank">Post Type Templates</a> &#8211; custom page template functionality is now available to all post types</li>\n<li><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-will-allow-developers-to-register-custom-bulk-actions-in-admin-list-tables" target="_blank">Custom bulk actions</a> &#8211; developers can register custom bulk actions for admin list tables</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/26/registering-your-settings-in-wordpress-4-7/" target="_blank">Expanded Settings Registration API</a> via register_setting()</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/08/wp_hook-next-generation-actions-and-filters/" target="_blank">WP_Hook overhaul</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress lead developer Helen Hou-Sandí led the 4.7 release with deputies Jeff Paul and Aaron Jorbin. A record-breaking 482 contributors had props on 4.7 and 205 of them were first-time contributors. More than 100 of those volunteers contributed to the Twenty Seventeen theme. Community translators made it possible for WordPress 4.7 to be available in 52 languages at release time and they also captioned the release video included below in 44 languages.

This year, it was produced by Rami Abraham.</p>\n<div id="v-AHz0Ca46-1" class="video-player"><div><img alt="Introducing WordPress 4.7" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/AHz0Ca46/wp4-7-vaughan-r8-mastered_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /></div><p>Introducing WordPress 4.7</p></div>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 includes so many changes and new features worth highlighting, I will note a few of what I consider the most important and noteworthy, but it is not all-encompassing. This has been the most productive release in a very long time.</p>\n<h3>WordPress REST API Content Endpoints</h3>\n<p>WordPress is now more extensible than ever before, thanks to the WordPress REST API and the Content Endpoints that have shipped with 4.7. The Content Endpoints are stage two of the REST API rollout, after the infrastructure was included <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-4-4/">in WordPress 4.4</a>.</p>\n<p>The Content Endpoints make it so developers can interact with all major content objects of WordPress: posts (including default and custom post types), terms, users, and comments.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to completely bypass the WordPress templating engine, now you can. You can use WordPress as a content store, and create a custom writing interface, or so many other things, thanks to this API that standardizes interfacing with WordPress.</p>\n<p>The implications for external applications are enormous. Third parties can now reliably anticipate how to work with any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>The WordPress REST API has reached a huge milestone, and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/19/wordpress-rest-api-success-metrics/">success metrics</a> have been created to track how things are going with it. But the core team already knows there is much left to do.</p>\n<p>With the <a href="https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/">new development cycle</a> Matt Mullenweg announced at WordCamp US just last week, the REST API will be one of three parts of WordPress that will have a major release dedicated to enhacing it. The goal is to expand the endpoints to include all site management features of WordPress, so that someone (or WordPress itself) could completely rebuild the WordPress administration experience from scratch, using the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p>I sincerely believe the REST API is a gamechanger for WordPress. Now, it&#8217;s your turn. Build stuff. Show the world what you&#8217;ve made! There will be official WordPress REST API showcase efforts underway soon to capture what folks are building.</p>\n<p>This project would absolutely not have happened without the following people: Ryan McCue and Rachel Baker for leading the effort, Daniel Bachhuber and Joe Hoyle for their constant work and guidance, K. Adam White for a huge 4.7 effort in project management and wrangling, and Helen Hou-Sandí for making the call to include the API in the release.</p>\n<p>Ready to get started with the WordPress REST API? The new <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">REST API Handbook</a> will be the home for documentation going forward.</p>\n<h3>Twenty Seventeen</h3>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen is the latest default theme for WordPress, and I believe the best since at least Twenty Twelve. The new default theme has a great multi-section front page feature that offers a great solution for small businesses to highlight their work in a single page format, with large featured images throughout.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26479 size-large" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twenty-seventeen-promo-752x313.png" alt="twenty-seventeen-promo" width="752" height="313" /></p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen was designed by Mel Choyce.</p>\n<h3>Adjusted editor layout</h3>\n<p>Many folks would consider it a minor change, but any change to the WordPress editor is a big one to me. As Andrew Ozz <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/28/editor-changes-in-4-7/">highlights in the Make Core post</a>, some of the buttons in the default editing toolbar have been moved around, based on statistics of usage.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30984" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-06-at-1.24.48-PM-752x447.png" alt="editor-toolbar-rearrangement" width="752" height="447" /></p>\n<p>Most notably, the headings drop down has been moved to the top row, and strikethrough and horizontal rule buttons have moved down. This is a good step in the right direction in supporting a better and easier to use editor.</p>\n<h3>New Customizer features</h3>\n<p>The WordPress Customizer is another of the three feature focus areas moving forward in WordPress development. And there&#8217;s a lot of new stuff in the Customizer with WordPress 4.7 that you should know about.</p>\n<h4>Video Headers</h4>\n<p>The new default theme supports <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/26/video-headers-in-4-7/">video headers</a>, a new feature in WordPress, managed within the customizer.</p>\n<h4>Visible Edit Shortcuts</h4>\n<p>The new visible edit shortcuts allow for someone using the customizer to see an icon next to the part of the page that is eligible to be edited in the customizer. It&#8217;s perhaps a small UX addition, but will be very helpful for folks customizing their websites.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30982" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-06-at-1.01.09-PM-752x405.png" alt="customize-icon" width="752" height="405" /></p>\n<h4>Create a Page Within a Menu</h4>\n<p>Finally, you can create pages from within the Menu Customizer. One of the most common site setup steps is to build your menu. But if you haven&#8217;t already created the pages you want to put there, you have to go do that and come back.</p>\n<p>Now users can create a page draft while in the Menu Customizer so that they don&#8217;t have to take unnecessary steps or understand the order WordPress expects. Small wins like this are invaluable for the new user experience.</p>\n<h4>Custom CSS</h4>\n<p>Creating custom CSS straight from the editor has long been a popular Jetpack feature, and it was ported to WordPress core.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30981" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-06-at-12.59.04-PM-752x438.png" alt="wordpress-edit-css" width="752" height="438" /></p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t exactly what I&#8217;d call a best practice, but it&#8217;s a common one. I&#8217;ve used custom CSS myself many times, especially for small sites where I just wanted to get something small done quickly. This feature brings a common request to core, and helps someone customize their sites quicker and without a third party plugin.</p>\n<h4>Starter content for themes</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the new starter content that WordPress themes can now include. This allows for smarter demos, so that the user better sees what the theme is designed for.</p>\n<p>Helen has a whole post <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/30/starter-content-for-themes-in-4-7/">describing exactly how it works</a>, but this is another feature that takes something that was not great in WordPress (especially for free themes in the WordPress directory) and drastically improves it.</p>\n<p>I really look forward to seeing this in action, and look forward to see how adoption of this feature impacts both free and commercial WordPress theme ecosystems.</p>\n<h3>Post type templates</h3>\n<p>Pages have long support custom templates for WordPress themes to define, and now this feature has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/03/post-type-templates-in-4-7/">extended to all post types</a>, with opt-in support.</p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s simple for theme authors to create a variety of templates so that content creators can pick and choose from a layout they want to utilize, just like they&#8217;ve always done for pages.</p>\n<h3>Check out the full field guide</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 packs a lot of punch, and I highly recommend looking through the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/12/05/wordpress-4-7-field-guide/">full field guide</a> on the various changes. I have not covered many of the developer focused features in this post, because Aaron has curated the Make Core posts that do a better job of it.</p>\n<p>Also check out the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.7">Codex page for WordPress 4.7</a> for more information on features and links to specific tickets.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>WordPress 4.7 is a monumental achievement and is the result of the efforts of hundreds.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Release Lead Helen Hou-Sandí, the core team, and all contributors. While the scheduled and strict-date releases worked really well and kept WordPress coming out on time every four months or so, I&#8217;m excited to see how the new setup mixes things up for WordPress.</p>\n<p>This was a heck of a way to go out with the previous method.</p>\n<p>Go <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download WordPress 4.7</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Dec 2016 19:28:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 “Vaughan”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4596";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/12/vaughan/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40344:"<p>Version 4.7 of WordPress, named “Vaughan” in honor of legendary jazz vocalist Sarah &#8220;Sassy&#8221; Vaughan, is available for download or update in your WordPress dashboard.

Personalize it with widgets, navigation, social menus, a logo, custom colors, and more. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, on any device, and for a wide range of users.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Your Site, Your Way</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 adds new features to the customizer to help take you through the initial setup of a theme, with non-destructive live previews of all your changes in one uninterrupted workflow.</p>\n<h3>Theme Starter Content</h3>\n<div class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(''video'');</script><![endif]-->\n<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/starter-content.mp4">https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/starter-content.mp4</a></div>\n<p>To help give you a solid base to build from, individual themes can provide starter content that appears when you go to customize your brand new site. This can range from placing a business information widget in the best location to providing a sample menu with social icon links to a static front page complete with beautiful images. Don’t worry &#8211; nothing new will appear on the live site until you’re ready to save and publish your initial theme setup.</p>\n<div>\n<h3>Edit Shortcuts</h3>\n<div class="wp-video"><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4">https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4</a></div>\n<p>Visible icons appear to show you which parts of your site can be customized while live previewing.

Now you can add new pages while building menus instead of leaving the customizer and abandoning your changes. Once you’ve published your customizations, you’ll have new pages ready for you to fill with content.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>Custom CSS</h3>\n<p><img class="wp-image-4607 size-medium alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-CSS.jpg?resize=300%2C158&ssl=1" /></p>\n<p>Sometimes you just need a few visual tweaks to make your site perfect. WordPress 4.7 allows you to add custom CSS and instantly see how your changes affect your site. The live preview allows you to work quickly without page refreshes slowing you down.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<hr />\n<div>\n<h3>PDF Thumbnail Previews</h3>\n<p><img class="wp-image-4609 size-medium alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-PDF.jpg?resize=300%2C158&ssl=1" /></p>\n<p>Managing your document collection is easier with WordPress 4.7.

Add more languages to your site and a user language option will show up in your user’s profiles.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<hr />\n<h2>Introducing REST API Content Endpoints</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 comes with REST API endpoints for posts, comments, terms, users, meta, and settings.</p>\n<p><img class="size-large wp-image-4600 alignnone" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-API.jpg?resize=632%2C205&ssl=1" alt="" /></p>\n<p>Content endpoints provide machine-readable external access to your WordPress site with a clear, standards-driven interface, paving the way for new and innovative methods of interacting with sites through plugins, themes, apps, and beyond.

Matt Mullenweg delivered his 11th annual State of the Word address to a rapt audience ready to celebrate WordPress&#8217; progress over the past year and hear the project leader&#8217;s vision for 2017.</p>\n<p>He began by thanking sponsors and volunteers who made the event possible by covering the bulk of the $516 actual cost per person. Mullenweg said sponsors cover roughly 85-95% of the cost of WordCamps worldwide. In 2016, the events sold a total 36,000 tickets, with costs subsidized by more than 1,000 sponsors.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said meetups are the leading indicator for WordCamps and these events have had the fastest growth the community has seen in five or six years. More than 62,566 people attended a local meetup in 58 countries and roughly one third of those were new members.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s been a great year for WordCamps and meetups &#8211; 115 total WordCamps hosted in 41 different countries. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/yVGkT0j52C">pic.twitter.com/yVGkT0j52C</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805156784763715584">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>WordPress Foundation to Create WordPress Community Support Subsidiary</h3>\n<p>In order to better accommodate the extraordinary growth of the global community, the WordPress Foundation will be restructuring its management of WordCamps. In 2016 the Foundation took in an estimated $4.3 million, up from $2.8 million in 2015, with 99.9% of those funds related to WordCamps. Mullenweg announced that the 501c nonprofit will move WordCamps to its own company, WordPress Community Support, forming a PBC (Public Benefit Corporation) that is fully owned by the Foundation.</p>\n<p>He explained that if certain things happened at WordCamps it could endanger the overall Foundation, so WordCamps will now be managed under their own entity where the events will have a little more flexibility in how they do things. The Foundation plans to support some like-minded nonprofits that are aligned with the overall education mission of the organization, including <a href="http://www.hackthehood.org/" target="_blank">Hack the Hood</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/index.php" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>, and <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/" target="_blank">Black Girls Code</a>. In 2017 the Foundation will also begin promoting hackathons to help nonprofits and NGO&#8217;s.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Foundation will focus on supporting like-minded non-profits, education/workshops, and hackathons that benefit non-profits/NGOs. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/6VfdP82KuM">pic.twitter.com/6VfdP82KuM</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805158678353608704">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Internationalization is Driving an Increase in Plugin Usage</h3>\n<p>Mullenweg shared a few stats about the plugin directory, which will soon be launching a new design with revamped search functionality. This year has seen a 20% increase in active plugin usage and a 34% increase in plugin downloads totaling 1.48 billion, which Mullenweg attributed to a spike in internationalization efforts over the past year. The number of translation contributors has grown from 5,000 in April 2015 to 17,000 as of November 2016.</p>\n<p>This year there were 1,598 plugins with language packs (up from 314 last year) and 1224 themes with language packs (up from 641 last year). Mullenweg noted that 2/3 of the world speaks one of 12 languages with native fluency and that WordPress covers all of these and many more. In fact, the 4.6 release shipped with support for 50 available languages. WordPress&#8217; top 10 plugins are now 82% complete in the top 12 languages.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The top 10 plugins are 82% complete in the top 12 languages. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/LnpEGv0p7o">pic.twitter.com/LnpEGv0p7o</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805161007349985280">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Mullenweg Continues to Push Calypso as the Future of the WordPress Interface</h3>\n<p>During the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">2015 State of the Word</a>, Mullenweg gave attendees a homework assignment to &#8220;learn JavaScript deeply&#8221; and <a href="https://youtu.be/TX6dXRL-jPU?t=59m14s" target="_blank">promised to submit a JavaScript patch before 4.7</a> came out. He submitted his first pull request to Calypso yesterday, Automattic&#8217;s from-scratch rewrite of WP admin using Node and React.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com users have widely adopted the new interface for publishing. Mullenweg shared statistics showing that 68% of posts went through Calypso since its launch, 17% via mobile, and 15% through the traditional wp-admin. Mobile app and mobile browser usage are also up. &#8220;We now need to start thinking about mobile devices as the primary way people are going to interact with WordPress in the future,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>From the time it launched, Mullenweg has said that Calypso, or something like it, would be the future of the WordPress interface. He reiterated this in his 2016 address and has committed some of Automattic&#8217;s JavaScript developers from the Calypso team to contribute full-time to core.</p>\n<p>If Calypso has a chance at becoming a promising replacement for the WordPress admin, its creators will need to broaden its interoperability with the WordPress plugin ecosystem. Mullenweg announced that Calypso is now plugin aware and is open to plugins with over 1M active sites.</p>\n<p>The next step on Calypso&#8217;s roadmap is to bring in support for Automattic&#8217;s plugins &#8211; WooCommerce, Akismet, Jetpack, and VaultPress. Mullenweg said the big focus for 2017 is to make plugins Calypso-aware, starting with a handful of the most popular ones before opening it up to all plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The hope is that Calypso, or something like it, is actually what becomes the interface that drives WordPress,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Since no one is currently building anything like Calypso and targeting core, it looks like the technology behind WordPress.com will be driving the evolution of WordPress in 2017.</p>\n<p>If Mullenweg&#8217;s goal is to make Calypso the primary publishing engine for core WordPress, one of the major challenges will be getting plugin developers on board with building compatibility for what is currently an Automattic product. What are the implications of contributing to greater Calypso adoption? If core brings in the Calypso interface in the future, would Automattic push to include its Reader and other WordPress.com functionality, as it has in the mobile apps? These are questions developers will need to weigh when considering whether to pursue a more application-type experience via the Calypso interface.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What''s next for Calypso?

The <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/" target="_blank">official recommendation for WordPress hosting</a> is now PHP 7 or higher. After WordPress.com switched to be 100% on PHP 7, Mullenweg said the network&#8217;s performance doubled and CPU load fell in half. Just 4% of self-hosted sites are on PHP 7, but the new recommendation should help move more hosts towards getting their customers updated.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/VrQffeOtG0">https://t.co/VrQffeOtG0</a> has been 100% switched over to PHP7, bringing significant performance improvements. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/MChiS9QBJh">pic.twitter.com/MChiS9QBJh</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805164029371158528">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Beginning in 2017, WordPress will have progressive enhancement for certain features that are only available for encrypted sites. Mullenweg announced that WordPress.org is now tracking HTTPS adoption. So far 11.45% of active WordPress websites are on HTTPS and <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-will-only-recommend-hosting-companies-offering-ssl-by-default-in-2017" target="_blank">the project will no longer recommend hosts that do not offer it by default</a>. &#8220;We want to bring more of the web to be secure, which is especially important in the post-Snowden era,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h3>Trying New Things: Major Changes Coming to WordPress&#8217; Core Release Cycle</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 release lead Helen Hou-Sandí joined Mullenweg on stage to highlight a few of the features and improvements that will be coming in the official release on Tuesday. The release is arguably one of the most exciting and successful updates for WordPress in some time, but Mullenweg has a new strategy for core development in 2017.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at a junction for WordPress where what got us here wont get us there,&#8221; Mullenweg said, after highlighting how the software&#8217;s market share has grown from 13.1% to 27.2% in the past five years.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg proposed a new structure for WordPress releases where design and user testing will lead the way. &#8220;I&#8217;m putting back on the &#8216;product lead&#8217; hat for 2017,&#8221; he said. The upcoming year will have no set release schedule. Mullenweg is upending WordPress&#8217; predictable release cycle in favor of tackling some larger items on the to-do list. He said the focus will be on performance and fixes to existing functionality in three main focus areas: WP REST API, the Editor, and the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said he is particularly interested in getting first-party usage of the REST API in the admin, in hopes of having it evolve to something the project can use for the next decade. If it doesn&#8217;t, he said core will consider bringing it back into a plugin specifically for developers.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said he feels the editor does not represent the core of WordPress publishing, a sentiment that many users agree with. He hopes to steer it toward a more block-based approach that unifies widgets and includes an interface for shortcodes.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s vision for the Customizer is to see all aspects of WordPress become more instant and provide the same interface and UI affordances as the editor. He announced that Ephox, the company behind TinyMCE, has agreed to work with the project to improve the core editing experience.</p>\n<p>Shifting from a time-based release cycle to one that is more project-based is a major departure from WordPress&#8217; previous release philosophy of &#8220;Deadlines are not arbitrary.&#8221; The project&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/" target="_blank">philosophy page</a> identifies the practice of delaying releases for one more feature as a &#8220;rabbit hole&#8221; that has been tested and found to be unpleasant. The new approach to core development makes no guarantee that WordPress will have any releases in 2017.</p>\n<p>If the experiment is not a success, the project&#8217;s days of frequent and fast iteration may be over for awhile. Mullenweg is willing to risk it in hopes of being able to provide more product-based leadership that will distinguish WordPress from its proprietary competitors.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Words of wisdom from <a href="https://twitter.com/kristatippett">@kristatippett</a>: "We only learn to walk when we risk falling down&#8211;" <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/6t5sD6Xjbm">pic.twitter.com/6t5sD6Xjbm</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805170327726780416">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re trying to counter stagnation,&#8221; Mullenweg said when asked about the new approach to releases in the Q&amp;A segment. &#8220;Even though we&#8217;ve had lots of releases, certain parts of WordPress have stagnated and haven&#8217;t made the leaps that they could.&#8221;  He suggested that being part of a feature plugin team will give developers a way to be involved in more active releases and continue to build momentum for eventual inclusion of their projects in core.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg plans to identify a tech lead and a design lead and will be working with them as the overall product lead. He envisions that when one area of WordPress gets to the point where the software can ship significant user-facing improvements, a release will be born.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at the point now where the steps WordPress needs to take are more significant to get the other 73% of the web it doesn&#8217;t have yet,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>In a return to WordPress&#8217; poetic roots, he concluded by reading a poem called <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/praise-song-day" target="_blank">Praise Song</a> for the Day by Elizabeth Alexander.</p>\n<p>The video of the State of the Word address will soon be available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpJf6LGZ0a4n9Lj4aVt9spg" target="_blank">WordPress&#8217; new YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 04 Dec 2016 18:50:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"Post Status: Matt Mullenweg State of the Word, 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=30865";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16802:"<p>Matt Mullenweg just completed the 2016 State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US 2016.</p>\n<p>This year, Matt focused on a variety of important topics, including the state of user experience in WordPress today, goals for future interface improvements, a WordPress growth council, internationalization gains, the further proliferation of secure websites, and important changes to the WordPress development process.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp US in Philadelphia</h3>\n<p>Matt began his talk by thanking the city of Philadelphia for being a great host of the first two WordCamp US events, as well as the sponsors, organizers, and volunteers that helped make WordCamp US one of the most successful and smoothest run WordCamps ever.</p>\n<p>He also said the per person cost for WordCamp US is over $500 per person, and that only the sponsors make that happen.

WordCamp Europe actually had more people than WordCamp US this year, which Matt took as a personal challenge for Nashville.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.tv/">WordPress.tv</a> published 26% more talks this year than the previous year, and now there is an official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/wordpress">WordPress channel on YouTube</a>, so more and more videos will begin to be available wherever people want to watch them.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp public benefit corporation and the WordPress Foundation</h3>\n<p>More than a year ago, work began to separate WordCamps from the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a>, in order to make WordPress event organizing more flexible and to better protect the WordPress trademarks that the foundation holds.</p>\n<p>One of the things the foundation is going to start doing is support like minded non-profits, and in 2017 will be sponsoring three: Hack the Hood, the Internet Archive, and Black Girls Code.</p>\n<p>Also, the foundation will start to promote hackathons for non-profits and NGOs.</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217;s extended family</h3>\n<p>Matt gave a shoutout to WordPress&#8217;s &#8220;cousins&#8221; like BuddyPress and bbPress, highlighting a lot of features that have gone into the software in the last year.</p>\n<h4>BuddyPress and bbPress</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org itself uses BuddyPress and bbPress. For ages, it&#8217;s used outdated versions of bbPress, and in the past year launched a new support form that uses modern bbPress and WordPress profiles use bbPress. Matt says projects like these will get new support and engagement over the next year.</p>\n<h4>HackerOne</h4>\n<p>HackerOne is a security website that allows software organizations to offer bounties to hackers for responsibly disclosing security bugs.</p>\n<h4>GlotPress</h4>\n<p>GlotPress has had a big transformation in the last year, as it is no longer standalone software on top of BackPress, but rather a plugin for WordPress. If you&#8217;ve never been to <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/">translate.WordPress.org</a>, you&#8217;ve seen GlotPress in action, and it&#8217;s pretty amazing.</p>\n<h4>WordPress.org</h4>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a> is a central hub for the WordPress community. Matt highlighted some of the work that&#8217;s been going on this past year around languages, support forums, and more. He also says that new work will be going into P2/O2, which are used for the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org">Make WordPress</a> blogs.</p>\n<p>And he gave attention to the new WordPress plugin repository, which finally uses WordPress itself, and has a whole new design. You can see the new design in action on the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins-wp/">demo site</a>, which should role out to the main Plugins directory soon.</p>\n<h3>WordPress in all languages</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.6 was available in 50 languages the day it was released. And the top 10 plugins are 82% translated in the top 12 languages used in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Language packs have been a huge help in helping translate plugins as a community project on Translate.WordPress.org, rather than having to ship translations inside the plugin itself.</p>\n<p>1,598 plugins are now using language packs, and 1,224 themes use them. This is huge for the future of WordPress working great in every language.</p>\n<p>Also, in WordPress 4.7, we&#8217;ll see per-user language choices.</p>\n<h3>Learning JavaScript Deeply</h3>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s homework for the community was to learn JavaScript deeply. He says that WordPress is 28% JavaScript now, which hasn&#8217;t changed, but he says we&#8217;ve still made a lot of progress.</p>\n<p>Matt gave himself a personal challenge to learn JavaScript, and he said that 364 days into this challenge, he submitted his first patch to Calypso (Automattic&#8217;s WordPress administration interface). He said, learning JavaScript and becoming as native with JavaScript as with PHP is going to be really important &#8212; especially as the REST API gets included in WordPress 4.7.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Growth Council</h3>\n<p>Matt recently posted about a WordPress Growth Council to help WordPress grow and maintain marketshare.</p>\n<p>He says that what got WordPress to where it is today, won&#8217;t get WordPress to where it can be tomorrow. He blogged about this <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/12/wp-growth-council/">new growth council</a>, which folks can apply for, which will help guide product direction in WordPress going forward.</p>\n<p>Matt actually said in Post Status Slack recently that if WordPress doesn&#8217;t make changes to the interface and otherwise, he&#8217;d expect WordPress marketshare would begin to decline by 2018.</p>\n<h3>HTTPS &amp; PHP7</h3>\n<p>11.45% of WordPress websites are now served via HTTPS. Matt talked last year about how LetsEncrypt and PHP7 were going to be a big deal, but they&#8217;ve turned out to be, &#8220;huge.&#8221; And WordPress will now start applying progressive enhancement techniques for WordPress websites.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com is now fully on PHP7, which he says was an enormous accomplishment. He&#8217;s also announced that <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">WordPress.org will now recommend</a> PHP7 by default.</p>\n<h3>Calypso</h3>\n<p>Matt gave some updates on <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">Calypso&#8217;s</a> adoption since it was released last year. He says that 68% of posts on WordPress.com are now written in Calypso. 17% of posts are written via a mobile device, and only 15% of users are using the WordPress admin. For reference, Calypso is the default method of publishing on WordPress.com now, so that includes the desktop website, desktop app, and mobile app.</p>\n<p>Matt says that building Calypso is like, &#8220;building a plane while it&#8217;s flying.&#8221; And while it&#8217;s hard, he says it&#8217;s worth it, but it&#8217;s like rebuilding WordPress &#8212; which took 13 years to do &#8212; in only two years.</p>\n<p>The future of Calypso includes making it &#8220;plugin aware&#8221;, so that prominent plugins (most Automattic plugins included) would be recognized and manageable via Calypso.</p>\n<p>In fact, Calypso is plugin aware today, as the merge has just happened. So now plugins can include custom code to be manageable via Calypso. This is an interesting move to me, especially since Calypso &#8212; while open source &#8212; isn&#8217;t an official WordPress project, but rather an Automattic-owned interface.</p>\n<p>Matt says that someday he&#8217;s like to see Calypso, &#8220;or something like it,&#8221; eventually to become the WordPress interface.</p>\n<h3>Core releases in 2016</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.5-4.7 will have been released by the end of 2016. Matt says, &#8220;this is very much a year about doing things differently.&#8221; And in that spirit, he&#8217;s pre-announcing the jazz musician in the release. I&#8217;m sure Jeffro will be pleased <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" /> WordPress 4.7 will be named &#8220;Vaughan&#8221;, after jazz musician Sarah &#8220;Sassy&#8221; Vaughan.</p>\n<p>Helen Hou-Sandi came to the stage to discuss WordPress 4.7 in more detail.</p>\n<h3>WordPress 4.7</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 will include a variety of features, and will be released on Tuesday, December 6th.</p>\n<h4>New default theme</h4>\n<p>WordPress includes a new default theme that with a multi-section home page that&#8217;s a brand new WordPress feature. And generally Twenty Seventeen has a lot more broad base appeal for businesses and non-blogging applications than many past themes.</p>\n<h4>Theme setup process</h4>\n<p>Helen really wanted to focus on user interactions in WordPress 4.7. She used the example of her &#8220;tweet storm&#8221; about what it&#8217;s like to change a theme, which took dozens of steps and included a lot of unclear processes.</p>\n<p>Themes in 4.7 can define content that ships with the theme, such as a nav menu setup, sample page content, a password protected page, and other content that would be utilized in the theme. This will be a massive improvement in the initial theme setup experience that I love to see in 4.7.</p>\n<h4>Better menu handling</h4>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 includes better menu building that will also assist the new user experience. Now when you are building a menu in the customizer, you can add a page right from the menu screen, so that if you haven&#8217;t yet written your &#8220;about&#8221; page or whatever else, you&#8217;ll be able to create that draft straight from the menu screen, so the user doesn&#8217;t have to know exactly which flow is necessary to setup their site.</p>\n<h4>&#8220;Sleeper hits&#8221;</h4>\n<p>Helen highlights sleeper features, like thumbnail previews for PDFs and user dashboard languages so a user can use a different language than is set by the site administrator.</p>\n<h4>The WordPress REST API</h4>\n<p>To big applause, Helen noted the inclusion of the WordPress REST API Content Endpoints in 4.7. She says that she&#8217;s excited to take the momentum and excitement around the API and turn it into more real-world projects where people test and put it to practice.</p>\n<h4>Deputy leads</h4>\n<p>Jeff Paul and Aaron Jorbin were the deputy release leads for 4.7, and more than 475 contributors submitted code to 4.7. Over 200 of those contributors are first time contributors.</p>\n<h4>Sneak preview video</h4>\n<p>To end the preview of WordPress 4.7, Helen shared a sneak preview of the WordPress 4.7 video, created by friend Rami Abraham, that highlights &#8220;Carly&#8221;, who is a small business owner building her business website. The video shows a couple more great sleeper hits, like customizer preview icons to help editing, and video headers.</p>\n<h4>That&#8217;s WordPress 4.7</h4>\n<p>WordPress 4.7, I believe, is going to be one of the best releases we&#8217;ve seen in a long, long time. It&#8217;s jam packed, and while I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have plenty of follow-on work, there&#8217;s been a hugely ambitious effort with tons of awesome contributors. None of it would&#8217;ve happened without Helen.</p>\n<h4>WordPress REST API and examples</h4>\n<p>After the video, Matt came back on stage.</p>\n<p>Matt highlighted some of the REST API examples, including the new <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/">Guggenheim Museum</a> website and <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/">Vocativ</a>, which both use the new API, and are powered by Content Endpoints.</p>\n<h3>A look at the past and future</h3>\n<p>Matt spent a few minutes reflecting over this past, and busy, year; but also spent time discussing the past few years and what&#8217;s in store in the future.</p>\n<p>Matt recognized the &#8220;predictable&#8221; release cycle that we moved to around WordPress 3.8, and how that&#8217;s been a huge benefit for the platform in general.</p>\n<p>In the past five years, we&#8217;ve seen WordPress go from 13.1% to 27.2%, and this kind of marketshare for a CMS is &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He says, &#8220;What can we try next?&#8221; In other words, he wants to do things differently going forward: &#8220;What got us here, won&#8217;t get us there.&#8221; In order to do this, he&#8217;s proposing a new structure for core development.</p>\n<p>Matt said he wants to see a simpler, faster UX, while simultaneously making it more powerful. This has been my number one goal for WordPress the last few years, so I&#8217;m thrilled to see him highlight it. In the coming releases, he, &#8220;wants to see design leading the way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2017, Matt says he&#8217;s going to be a heavily involved project lead again.</p>\n<h3>No set major releases in 2017</h3>\n<p>Matt made a huge announcement by saying that there will be no set releases in 2017. WordPress Core will continue to move forward, managing maintenance and other items, but will shift to three main focuses for features that will dictate the next several major releases:</p>\n<h4>1) The WordPress REST API</h4>\n<p>He says we need shift from thinking about the input, to measuring the output. He wants the conversation of success metrics to get beyond the &#8220;thousands&#8221; when, &#8220;WordPress is in the tens of millions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matt sees powering the WordPress admin with the REST API as a core focus for 2017. In addition, this effort will include shipping authentication tools in WordPress core, so that external applications can connect to WordPress websites. He says if we can&#8217;t move forward with this goal, then we need to consider making the API a plugin again.</p>\n<h4>2) The Editor</h4>\n<p>Matt wants to see a lot of work on the WordPress editing experience. Matt says he showed &#8220;block-baced editor&#8221; (some may remember this as &#8220;content blocks&#8221;) in a State of the Word slide a few years ago, and calls the WordPress editor his &#8220;white whale&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He says we need to be candid about our shortcomings with WordPress so that we can more effectively move forward. Andrew Ozz and Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe have been massively influential on the editor improvements we&#8217;ve seen over the past few years, and their contributions will be huge for moving this goal forward.</p>\n<h4>3) The Customizer</h4>\n<p>&#8220;The customizer is not yet fast enough, and flexible enough, to meet our current needs.&#8221; He&#8217;s excited to see all the new work going into the customizer, but knows there&#8217;s a lot of work to do to take the customizer to the next step.</p>\n<h3>How to get these goals accomplished</h3>\n<p>He says that new major versions of WordPress will not be released until these features are ready. He says that as each project is completed, there will be a major release to go around it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fascinated by this new approach. It&#8217;s like taking the current feature project framework and taking it multiple levels up. It&#8217;s definitely a way to shake things up, and that may be great, considering so many people in the WordPress space enjoy complaining about the slow process that is WordPress feature development.</p>\n<p>Matt, as project lead, says he&#8217;ll personally be taking these on as the lead. And work will begin immediately to make it happen.</p>\n<p>So, I don&#8217;t know if the next release will be called WordPress 4.8, or when it will be, but I&#8217;d be shocked if it&#8217;s four months like past releases. But I guess we&#8217;ll see a lot of minor releases for all the other aspects of core development.</p>\n<p>Matt says he thinks we&#8217;ll fall while we learn to walk in this new way, and that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I have to admit, these are some pretty surprising announcements. I&#8217;m excited to dig more into the particulars over the coming weeks, but I do think this serves as a worthwhile and important jolt into WordPress core development. That&#8217;s not to say I think WordPress development has been bad, I think it&#8217;s been great.</p>\n<p>Matt finished by reading a poem by Elizabeth Alexander, titled, &#8220;<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/52141">Praise Song For The Day</a>&#8221; that marked a fitting end to the talk.</p>\n<p>I think the key takeaway should be like he said: &#8220;what got us here, won&#8217;t get us there.&#8221; Let&#8217;s see how this goes.</p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: Brian Richards for Post Status.</em></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Dec 2016 22:20:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Matt: WordCamp Live Stream";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46945";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://ma.tt/2016/12/wordcamp-live-stream/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:298:"<p>Later today (3:45pm ET) I&#8217;ll deliver my annual State of the Word speech, which I&#8217;m very excited about.

The Japanese development company specializes in WordPress and AWS integrations. Shifter was built by the same team behind the company&#8217;s <a href="https://amimoto-ami.com/" target="_blank">Amimoto</a> cloud hosting platform.</p>\n<p>Shifter converts WordPress sites into a series of static HTML files and serves them up via a global CDN (AWS) for high performance hosting, eliminating the burden of software maintenance and server updates. The product targets websites that have a low frequency of updates, such as business or portfolio sites, as well as maintenance and support providers.</p>\n<p>Shifter allows site owners to turn WordPress on or off in its administration center. The service is a hybrid of a WordPress static site generator and a hosting solution. Shifter hosts the static files it creates and allows users to connect their domains. It leaves the standard WordPress management and administration workflow intact and compiles a new version of the static files anytime users update content inside WordPress. The service starts at $30/month and offers support for unlimited sites.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shifter-dashboard.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shifter-dashboard.png?resize=1025%2C652&ssl=1" alt="Shifter dashboard" class="size-full wp-image-64166" /></a>Shifter dashboard\n<p>As the first commercial product to provide serverless WordPress hosting, Shifter offers a unique way to tackle the security concerns that plague WordPress and its plugins and themes. Because the software is used by more than 27% of all websites, it has become a big target for hackers and spammers alike. Shifter&#8217;s creators see WordPress as a prime candidate for serverless architecture.</p>\n<p>DigitalCube team members met the Philadelphia-based <a href="http://j2made.com/" target="_blank">J2 Design</a> company at last year&#8217;s WordCamp US and partnered with them to improve their branding, copy writing, and approach.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At that time, we were having problems in design, branding, and communication,&#8221; product liaison Shinichi Nishikawa said. &#8220;The name &#8216;Amimoto&#8217; was originally a Japanese word and was difficult for people to pronounce or remember. We saw their work and asked them if we could form a partnership.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Together the Amimoto and J2 Design teams took the project from concept to launch in about three months. They built Shifter with AWS, Docker, and the Serverless Framework. The development team behind the project also supports and manages sites such as The Japan Times, AOL Japan, and Mazda. They frequently contribute to open source projects, including WordPress, Serverless Framework, and WP-CLI.</p>\n<p>Shifter has exited beta and the company has <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/225627578/shifter-serverless-hosting-for-wordpress" target="_blank">launched a Kickstarter campaign</a> with a $10,000 goal to fund future development on the project&#8217;s <a href="https://getshifter.io/blog/development-roadmap/" target="_blank">roadmap</a>, including domain mapping, a way to visualize usage of bandwidth and storage, multi-factor authentication, advanced scheduling, and WP-CLI support.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Dec 2016 03:44:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Matt: WP Growth Council";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46933";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"https://ma.tt/2016/12/wp-growth-council/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1594:"<p>In the WordPress world, when we look back an 2016 I think we&#8217;ll remember it as the year that we awoke to the importance of marketing. WordPress has always grown organically through word of mouth and its passionate community, but the hundreds of millions being spent advertising against WP has started to have an impact, especially for folks only lightly familiar with us.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve started to hear about a number of folks across many WordPress companies and industries working on this from different angles, some approaching it from an enterprise point of view and some from a consumer point of view. There&#8217;s an opportunity for learning from each other, almost like a mastermind group. As the survey says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Never have there been more threats to the open web and WordPress. Over three hundred million dollars has been spent in 2016 advertising proprietary systems, and even more is happening in investment.

The application was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/claygriffiths" target="_blank">Clay Griffiths</a>, who will be joining Flywheel to support the product as part of the acquisition.</p>\n<p><a href="https://pressmatic.io/" target="_blank">Pressmatic</a> launched in July 2016 with a $129 price tag but Flywheel is opening it up for free for all users. The company is rebranding the product as &#8220;Local by Flywheel&#8221; and plans to create a Windows application, add off-site backups for local sites, and sell premium support.</p>\n<p>“From the start, the application encompassed so many of Flywheel’s core values: speed, simplicity, and allowing designers and developers the freedom to do what they love,&#8221; Flywheel CEO and co-founder Dusty Davidson said. &#8220;It’s a perfect fit.”</p>\n<p>Griffiths told the Tavern that he is excited for the opportunities that Flywheel can provide for Local going forward. &#8220;I originally built Pressmatic because I saw the gap that existed for a truly great local WordPress development experience, and now with the resources and team at Flywheel we&#8217;re set to really build something great,&#8221; Griffiths said. &#8220;I certainly could have continued to go at it alone, but after meeting the team it became clear that the right answer was to partner up and really go big.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Griffiths Plans to Continue Headway Themes Support and Development in his Spare Time</h3>\n<p>The acquisition comes just months after Griffiths, who is also the co-founder of Headway Themes, was embroiled in the controversy surrounding the company&#8217;s lack of communication and decline in support. Many potential customers were turned off to Pressmatic as the result of Griffith&#8217;s lack of support for Headway Themes&#8217; customers and its mistreatment of employees. They company publicly confirmed its financial troubles and <a href="https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-confirms-financial-difficulties-issues-apology-to-customers" target="_blank">apologized to customers</a> after <a href="https://wptavern.com/former-headway-themes-employee-goes-public-staff-has-not-been-paid-and-customers-are-not-receiving-support" target="_blank">a former employee went public</a> about not having been paid and customers not receiving support.</p>\n<p>When asked how the Pressmattic acquisition affects Headway Themes customers, Griffiths confirmed that he will continue to be involved with support and development of Headway.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This acquisition and employment will provide myself and my family much more stability than we&#8217;ve had in a long time, and will allow me to better focus on Headway in my spare time,&#8221; Griffiths said. &#8220;This includes rolling out the upcoming 4.1 release, and working hard to make sure the support and other outstanding issues are resolved for all our customers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pressmatic is used by hundreds of WordPress developers and is Flywheel&#8217;s first acquisition. The application was built on top of <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a>, an app framework that enables developers to build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to run apache or nginx, switch between PHP versions for any site, create multisite installations (including subdomain setups), and create remote tunnels to share local development.

I am a digital tinkerer who has fallen in love with and currently gone steady with WordPress. Still, the journey is rough.</p>\n<p>A little about my home country before you hear my story…</p>\n<h3>Malawi</h3>\n<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malawi"><img class="alignright wp-image-1507" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/googleit.gif" alt="Gif of guy reading book, another guy slapping it away, saying Google It" width="295" height="166" /></a>Malawi, is at the time of my writing, the poorest country in the world. A tiny land locked country with a population of 17 million, AND still largely rural (about 75%) and struggling to develop.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The average entry level monthly pay for skilled jobs is about $110.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You are really fortunate if you are employed, young, working in the creative industry and earning somewhere near $300 a month. I doubt if anybody <em>actually</em> <strong>employed</strong> by someone in the design, creative and web services industry earns this much.</p>\n<p>That being said, I have been a freelance graphic designer since about 2011, doing gigs from my dorm room in college and my bedroom at home. Earnings from my freelance gigs increased my interest in entrepreneurship and I soon started entertaining the thought of starting my own creative agency or media powerhouse.</p>\n<h3>HOW I FIRST CAME INTO CONTACT WITH WORDPRESS</h3>\n<p>I first came into contact with WordPress in 2014 when a friend of mine from University were planning to start a local tech blog. Before WordPress, all I had was basic and outdated HTML knowledge I learned from high school and some knowledge in Adobe Dreamweaver.</p>\n<p>In 2014 very few websites in Malawi actually ran on WordPress as far as I remember. Most of the websites made in Malawi looked pretty archaic. With what to me was my partners expertise with WordPress Our blog looked like it came from the future. My partner knew where to get the themes (I did not know how he did it then, and still understood very little about WordPress).</p>\n<p>In a little while, ecstatic from the praise and positive feedback from the blog we decided to pursue the idea of opening our own content and media publishing outfit.</p>\n<p>Because our blog looked spectacular we got a few web redesign jobs thanks to the exposure the blog brought. We were ecstatic.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we both had very little administrative and business skills we could not maintain the business and we ended up going our separate ways.</p>\n<p>Fast forward post college, out of my first real job that I got in the TV industry ( terrible pay, overworked, and not being paid for about 5 months!) and failing to get more rewarding gigs as my creative agency start up side was cash strapped.</p>\n<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1509" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rowan.gif" alt="Rowan Atkinson looking shocked" width="355" height="200" />I finally took it upon myself to learn the ins and outs of WordPress. I learned how to install WordPress on a server and did some research on customising Themes. That knowledge alone and presto: I got my first web design clients and started making earning nearly as much as I did at my first job, sometimes a little more, when I get fortunate  some times I even earn three times as much as I used to in a month.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It only took a very short while for me to realise that free WordPress themes can only go so far, especially with my limited code skills.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For most WordPress designers in Malawi, all we did was get nulled themes and customise them. This is the way most WordPress designers in developing countries survive. This is also why I would like to build my own themes from scratch, to avoid the situation where I have to use pirated themes that are not only unsafe for clients but unethical. In addition, I know learning to code will also set me apart from my competition.</p>\n<p>Which leads me to the next bit….</p>\n<h3>HOW THE LACK OF AN ONLINE PAYMENT SOLUTIONS AFFECTS DESIGNERS/DEVELOPERS IN COUNTRIES LIKE MINE</h3>\n<p>My country apparently has PayPal “available”, but the truth is you cannot get yourself a credit card to be able to join creative markets, and do online courses in order to improve your WP skills. The banks here only issue out credit cards to people who travel overseas or apparently have millions in their bank account.</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/city.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1510 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/city-1024x576.png" alt="City Street in Malawi" width="960" height="540" /></a></p>\n<p>Even so, most of the bank personnel themselves know very little about credit cards and let alone online payment solutions. It is often very frustrating to talk to bank personnel concerning this. Wire transfer and Western Union is still the most popular way to make transactions for goods and services. So many services that we would like to access: plugins, features, etc related to the WP community are far from our reach. The learning and growth often stops the moment you see the “$” sign on websites offering WP solutions and themes.</p>\n<h3>THE CHALLENGES OF BEING SELF TAUGHT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD</h3>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, I do not have any programming background, I have always been more of a creative and artsy kind of person. Sure I have an eye for design but in order to grow, I need to learn to code PHP, and PHP hard and it is not easy to do so as premium online courses are inaccessible.</p>\n<p>When you are in a position like mine, you are already deep in freelancing and getting a job is currently not the best option because the pay is terrible for people in your industry, and you have to keep on earning, plus make time to learn code. Getting to actually code well is a chore as you have to mind all the other obligations.</p>\n<p>Between the time to make pitches to clients, finish up graphic design projects, deal with our current load shedding program (we only have about 5 hours of power a day on average now! ) is something I am barely managing.</p>\n<p>Teaching myself code, HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, and PHP for WordPress is something I am determined to do and always in the process of. I try my best to make time to learn. I reckon this would have been easier if I studied a programming course in college but well, here I am.</p>\n<h3>WHAT THE WORDPRESS COMMUNITY LOOKS LIKE TO ME</h3>\n<p>I will be honest, I have only gotten in touch with the actual WordPress community only very recently. Of course I search for solutions from blogs about WordPress but never actually talked to or asked anyone from the community for a solution. The most personal interaction I have ever had with anyone from the WordPress community is when I talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/topher1kenobe">Topher</a> when I applied to write a post for HeroPress.</p>\n<p>I often just isolated myself from any attempt to interact at all because of the glass ceiling. There are these feelings you get; these things you tell yourself when you know you can never truly harness the power of WordPress because of your lack of a way to pay for stuff online: You could never be half as good as anyone in developed countries, you will never ever get premium support, you can never be eligible for premium support. I reckon these feelings are worse for people teaching them self how to code like me.</p>\n<p>So when I came across a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/heropress">@HeroPress</a> about a post that talked about how WordPress marginalises some, it piqued my interest. It was a post from a WordPress developer in India, and it detailed how people from developing countries could never paid the same way someone from the developed countries would for the same skills or services. I totally relate and knew right away I need to sign up to tell my story.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress designers and wanna-be developers like me (who cannot access online pay systems) often feel side lined.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to classes, we stop at the freebies portion, often than not our Google Searches look like this</p>\n<p>“Free image slider plugins for WordPress” “Free WordPress tutorials”</p>\n<p>I wish more developers, or people with more global privilege would consider alternate ways for users who cannot pay for courses, themes, or plugins would make. We may not seem to be present, but we are there. I would love to see more WordPress tutors and developers open up ways to accommodate aspiring learners like me who cannot access plugins, courses and themes, to be able to give back and to participate at another level.</p>\n<p>Many wannabe developers who come from situations similar to mine often shy away from participating with the WordPress community or getting deeper with WordPress because in the ways I have mentioned above, the WordPress community feels like it belongs to those only privileged enough on the internet.</p>\n<p>WordPress has allowed me to find income I otherwise would not have any way in hopes of earning. Sure it is lower by global standards, but it makes a huge difference where I live. This is about to be my second year with WordPress, and coming across members of the community with varying backgrounds through HeroPress’ stories tells me there is hope for WordPress users like me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe through sharing stories like these not only will WordPress products/services be more accessible but aspiring self-taught developers like me will also find more courage in reaching out to connect with others out there.</p></blockquote>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div

Before I got married, I was staying in Chapra, a small city in Bihar. I had graduated in Botany, we only had electricity for 5-6 hours a day and no easy access to internet or computers.</p>\n<p>After my marriage, I came to Pune, a bigger city compared to Chapra and things changed for me. I was exposed to exciting world of technology, thanks to my husband who was then working at a startup. I had lot of free time so I decided to learn as much as I could just to see what I can do and started by learning MS Office, then Photoshop a bit and in the process I also learned HTML, CSS. I tried but couldn’t get much hang of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Once I got confident that I can write decent HTML, I switched to learning CMS and first one I tried was Joomla, and for me it was very hard to understand, I had more question then I could find answers to. So on suggestion of my husband I switched to WordPress. I was able to quickly figure things out with WordPress and set up a blog for myself.</p>\n<p>In 2010, I joined WPoets as QA. In those days I had some free time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To improve my skills I started looking into old reviews of the themes that were approved on WordPress themes repository.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This helped me understand theme file structures and various criteria to check themes for, I used skills acquired to ensure themes built by WPoets were also following these guidelines.</p>\n<p>Sometime in 2011, once I was confident that I have understood the process I joined the ‘Theme Review Team’ and started officially reviewing themes in the repository. This was a proud moment for me.  During my journey as theme reviewer I was helped and guided by Emil Uzelac, Chip Bennett &amp; Edward Caissie.</p>\n<p>In 2013, very first WordCamp was organised in Pune and I got a chance to talk about theme review process, this was my first ever public talk, and not being very good with English I choose to speak in Hindi. It was well received and many people wanted to know how they can get their themes approved. Again in 2015, I talked about what makes themes good in <a href="https://2015.pune.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Pune</a>. Thanks to WordCamps, I got to meet <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-family/">Topher</a>, <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/breaking-the-silence/">Mahangu</a> &amp; <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/finding-hope-darkness/">Raghvendra</a>.</p>\n<p>Now a days, as I get less time between work and kids, instead of doing theme reviews I answer questions on WordPress.org support forum.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m an introvert and came from a small city so I&#8217;m always hesitant to talk to new people but the WordPress community give me confidence to talk with new people and in front of people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a big achievement for me and my family feels proud of it.</p>\n<p>In WP community every one ready to support and help to move forward because of this nature I love to this community. I want to emphasize the support that I have received from WordPress community in general and members of theme review team in specific who helped me gain the knowledge necessary to do my work better. I also want to thank all the organisers of Pune WordPress Knowledge Exchange meetup group, and specially <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/ill-keep-looking-for-a-cms-unless-i-find-wordpress/">Saurabh Shukla</a> who helped in improving my presentation skills for WordCamp Pune.</p>\n<p>All these happened because of WordPress community and via HeroPress platform I would like to thank everyone who makes this community rock.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Building Confidence" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Building%20Confidence&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-confidence%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Building Confidence" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-confidence%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-confidence%2F&title=Building+Confidence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Building Confidence"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/building-confidence/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/112316-150x150.jpg&description=Building Confidence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Building Confidence"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/building-confidence/" title="Building Confidence"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/building-confidence/">Building Confidence</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 12:00:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Nisha Singh";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: Automattic Clarifies .blog Landrush Process After Bait and Switch Allegations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63947";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"https://wptavern.com/automattic-clarifies-blog-landrush-process-after-bait-and-switch-allegations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6001:"<p>Earlier this year, Knock Knock Whois There LLC, an Automattic subsidiary in partnership with Primer Nivel, <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-oversee-the-sale-and-registration-of-top-level-blog-domains">won an auction</a> for around $19 million dollars to offer top-level .blog domains.

Belcastro says that as a registrar, they&#8217;re able to activate up to 100 domain names. Some of the domains were given to <a href="https://my.blog/founders/">third-parties</a> and 25 generic domains were given to WordPress.com to be shared for free with millions of users.</p>\n<p>The registrar reserved all one, two, and three-character domains from being registered. They also allowed Automattic employees to reserve a single domain each, some of which were first names.</p>\n<p>On behalf of .blog, Belcastro apologized to those who filed applications in August and later discovered the domains were not available.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many registrars started taking pre-registrations for the Landrush period as early as last August. We do realize that some users were disappointed when they discovered that the domain names they had applied for were in fact attributed as part of the Founder’s program, or reserved, and wouldn’t be possible to register or auction at the end of Landrush.</p>\n<p>We would like to apologize to these users, but as the lists of Founder domains and Reserved ones weren’t final until just before Landrush, we couldn’t communicate them to registrars in advance (there is nothing registrars hate more than ever-changing lists of reserved domains).</p>\n<p>In addition, domains were removed as well as added to the lists, and we didn’t want to take the risk for registrars to refuse applications in September for domains that would be released in October.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To mitigate the uncertainty surrounding domain availability, fees were set up in a way so that only successful registrations would be charged. This provided a way to give full refunds to those with failed applications.</p>\n<p>Schidle appreciates the company&#8217;s apology, &#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate that their reserved domain list wasn&#8217;t finalized prior to accepting applications, and that affected applicants like myself weren&#8217;t notified sooner (auctions were scheduled to begin on November 14th),&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think they realize their mistake in handling that communication and their apology is appreciated.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 00:03:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: WordPress Passes 27% Market Share, Banks on Customizer for Continued Success";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63735";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-passes-27-market-share-banks-on-customizer-for-continued-success";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18467:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-brushes.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-brushes.jpg?resize=960%2C510&ssl=1" alt="photo credit: Luis Llerena" class="size-full wp-image-63978" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/265GAALCWG">Luis Llerena</a>\n<p>WordPress now powers <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" target="_blank">27.1% of all websites on the internet</a>, up from 25% last year. While it may seem that WordPress is neatly adding 2% of the internet every year, its percentage increase fluctuates from year to year and the climb is getting more arduous with more weight to haul.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wordpress-market-share.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wordpress-market-share.png?resize=1025%2C256&ssl=1" alt="credit: w3techs.com" class="size-full wp-image-63933" /></a>credit: <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y">w3techs.com</a>\n<p>In January 2015, Mullenweg said the next goal for WordPress was <a href="https://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share" target="_blank">to achieve 50% market share</a> (the majority of websites) and he identified Jetpack as a key factor in preventing WordPress&#8217; decline, a controversial statement delivered at Pressnomics. At that time Automattic was secretly working on <a href="https://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">Calypso</a>, WordPress.com&#8217;s JavaScript-powered interface, but did not unveil the project until November 2015.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to say what effect Calypso has had on WordPress&#8217; market share, as the w3tech&#8217;s 27% stat covers mostly self-hosted sites. Following up with him a year later, Mullenweg estimates that less than 10% of those sites are hosted on WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It does look like about a quarter of it is using Jetpack, though, and that has grown since Calypso was released,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Remember &#8211; Calypso is for Jetpack sites as well as WP.com.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href="https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-240-interview-with-matt-mullenweg-2016" target="_blank">interview on WPWeekly</a>, Mullenweg said he is also optimistic that the WooCommerce acquisition and <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-oversee-the-sale-and-registration-of-top-level-blog-domains" target="_blank">Automattic&#8217;s sale and management of the .blog domain</a> extension will contribute &#8220;another 5-10% each to that market share.&#8221; In fact, there is a team inside Automattic called Team 51 that works on strategies for getting the market share to 51%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For getting to 51% and beyond &#8211; it&#8217;s more than just blogs and more than just websites,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We need to do stores well, we need to do wikis well, we need to do real estate sites well, we need to do restaurants well &#8211; all these things that may be outside what you normally think of as a core WP experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to provide the best content-creation experience on the market, in any niche, WordPress has some major work to do. The software is in imminent danger of being eclipsed by newer competitors if its core features don&#8217;t improve, especially when it comes to customizing a new site. Jetpack cannot single-handedly solve WordPress&#8217; onboarding problem.</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217; Weakest Link Is Also Its Greatest Opportunity</h3>\n<p>In the past Mullenweg has identified customization as the weakest link in WordPress but also one of its most important areas for improvement, saying, &#8220;The Customizer is everything.&#8221; During the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">2015 State of the Word</a> address he said, &#8220;Customization is the single biggest opportunity for improving the WordPress experience.&#8221; I asked him if he thinks the necessary improvements to make the software more competitive need to come from core itself or if commercial products could introduce game changers for the Customizer, the editor, and other problem areas of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think to have an impact on WordPress&#8217; growth improvements to customization have to happen in core or Calypso/Jetpack, otherwise there isn&#8217;t enough reach,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how great a commercial product is &#8211; being behind a paywall will mean it won&#8217;t reach enough people to make a dent in WP&#8217;s growth curve.&#8221; He outlined how he sees the Customizer as a critical component of WordPress&#8217; future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think the needed improvements will only come from a customizer and theme system which is flexible, intuitive, and instantaneous, which might also need to break backwards compatibility, and a post editor which leverages the same language, patterns, interface, and concepts. We need to use and adopt a React / Redux approach to the javascript, like Calypso, and rename or make irrelevant concepts like Menus which are just plain confusing to people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Customizer improvements have been a focus throughout 2016 and the feature&#8217;s small team of contributors have made major strides towards improving the underlying architecture to build upon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <em>customization</em> that is the key need here, not necessarily the existing &#8216;Customizer&#8217; interface that we have today,&#8221; <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/customize/" target="_blank">Customize</a> component maintainer Weston Ruter said. &#8220;The key need WordPress has is to be able to live preview more functionality in WordPress, as Helen tweeted here:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if instead of opposing "shoving more stuff into the customizer" we supported "adding live previews to WordPress functionality"?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Helen 侯-Sandí (@helenhousandi) <a href="https://twitter.com/helenhousandi/status/778255682462183424">September 20, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/customizer-responsive-preview-and-selective-refresh-to-be-merged-into-wordpress-4-5" target="_blank">Selective refresh</a> was added earlier this year in 4.5, giving WordPress the ability to preview elements without full page reloads. This is one way the Customize API addresses that &#8220;instantaneous&#8221; aspect Mullenweg outlined above.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The <a href="https://make.xwp.co/2016/04/29/customize-posts-v0-5-released/" target="_blank">Customize Posts</a> plugin is an effort to rebuild the post editor from the ground up with live preview for all changes to post data and postmeta at the foundation,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a JavaScript-first approach to the post editing experience. No more waiting for a full page reload to save a draft. No more clicking a preview button to load the post in a new window. All of the changes are saved as drafts and previewed live. It&#8217;s reusing the TinyMCE editor component.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress may be looking at <a href="https://wptavern.com/customize-posts-plugin-and-selective-refresh-are-paving-the-way-for-front-end-editing-powered-by-the-customizer" target="_blank">front-end editing powered by the Customizer</a> in the not-too-distant future. Ruter and contributors are also working towards using the Customize API to power the next generation of widgets in core, which would use JS for UI and open the door for widgets to be managed via the REST API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Changesets, coming in 4.7, is the most far-reaching architectural improvement to the customizer since its inception,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;Changesets allow for live preview functionality to be de-coupled from the current Customizer interface. This architecture allows for live preview to be developed in other contexts, namely on the frontend and in REST API-driven apps and headless sites.&#8221; Ruter anticipates the REST API endpoints for managing changesets to come in 4.8.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-js-widgets" target="_blank">WP JS Widgets</a> project shifts widgets away from their heavy reliance on PHP and creates a JavaScript foundation in the Customizer that allows for any library to be used to build widget controls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A control can actually be implemented using any JS technology stack,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;In the JS Widgets plugin I have a demonstration of widget controls in the customizer being built using the customizer Element, Backbone.js, and also React.&#8221; The plugin currently implements <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-js-widgets/tree/master/php/widgets" target="_blank">three core widgets</a> and contributors are working on more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s somewhat of a &#8216;Widgets 3.0&#8217; in core, focused on what they would look like in the Customizer first,&#8221; Ruter said, &#8220;where the widget instance data is stored in a setting, and the control listens to changes to that setting and updates its UI to reflect the changes in the underlying instance data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although this particular project is being built to be JavaScript-library agnostic, Ruter said he thinks there would be value in exploring the use of React/Redux in a “Customizer 2.0” interface:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It would be great to experiment with re-implementing the Customizer UI (pane, panels, sections, controls) in React. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Weston Ruter ⚡ (@westonruter) <a href="https://twitter.com/westonruter/status/672830761872064513">December 4, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Taking the Customizer Beyond First Impressions</h3>\n<p>Ruter said he would have a difficult time proposing to build a client site that depended on the WordPress admin for site management and content authorship.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of the work we&#8217;ve done at XWP for the past few years has been building on the Customizer to provide the editorial experiences that I think are lacking in the WP admin,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;We invest heavily in the customizer because we see it as the best foundation that WordPress has to offer to provide the experiences we want to deliver to our clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the Customizer is so critical to WordPress&#8217; success, it&#8217;s curious that the contributor team remains relatively small and few companies are investing in the feature specifically. <a href="https://xwp.co/" target="_blank">XWP</a> invests heavily in Customizer development and a great deal of that is prototype work in the form of feature plugins such as Customize Snapshots, Customize Posts, and several <a href="https://github.com/xwp?q=wp-customize" target="_blank">other plugin projects</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know for sure why more developers across the WordPress community aren&#8217;t doing more with the customizer,&#8221; said Ruter, who is CTO at XWP. &#8220;It may be in part a perception problem, where it has seemingly been stuck with a negative reputation. Or it could be a technology problem, where the Customizer is vastly different from other areas of WordPress being a JavaScript single-page application.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When the Customizer was first introduced it included support for &#8216;option&#8217; and &#8216;theme_mod,&#8217; followed by widgets and navigation menus a bit down the road. The WordPress community didn&#8217;t have a full understanding of the scope and capabilities of the Customizer for addressing some of the project&#8217;s chief concerns, including content authorship with live previews. Users simply saw a constrained UI they didn&#8217;t like using to customize themes. Most users had no concept of the Customizer providing the architectural underpinnings of other aspects of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the problem is a lack of contributors,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;But even more than that, the biggest problem is one of having a shared vision. When the WP community throws hate on customizer improvements with each new release, it&#8217;s somewhat demotivating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the community realized the vision behind and appreciated a full admin experience that had live preview and staging of changes, then that would make a huge difference,&#8221; Ruter said. He and contributors find it challenging to articulate the scope and they are considerably short-handed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It could be a problem with getting ramped up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s been the mandate for the WP community as a whole &#8211; to learn JavaScript deeply. I say, why not learn JavaScript deeply by building on the customizer?&#8221;</p>\n<h3>GoDaddy Plans to Invest in Core Customizer Improvements</h3>\n<p>GoDaddy is a surprising company to emerge over the past couple of years as another key player on WordPress&#8217; road to 50% market share. WordPress product and service companies, along with hosts, are keenly interested in seeing the software continue its market dominance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very important to GoDaddy that WP market share increases,&#8221; Gabe Mays, head of WordPress products at GoDaddy, said. &#8220;We&#8217;re deeply invested in the success of the WordPress community, not only because many of our customers use it, but also because of what it represents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays reports that approximately 1/3 of all GoDaddy sites and half of all new sites are running on WordPress. With millions of customers using the software, the company took the initiative to create a new <a href="https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-new-onboarding-experience-for-wordpress-customers" target="_blank">onboarding experience specifically for WordPress customers</a>. I asked Mays if GoDaddy is concerned about competitors like Wix and Weebly cutting into the WordPress market share.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if &#8216;worry&#8217; is the right word, because 1) we know the problem and 2) we&#8217;re capable of addressing it,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;As a community we either care enough to fix it or we don&#8217;t. There are negative consequences associated with the latter that pose an existential threat to the community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays has been involved with the WordPress community for the past 10 years and is working with GoDaddy to improve the new user experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the issue we’re experiencing now is that WordPress benefitted from such strong product market fit and, subsequently, such high growth that there weren’t the typical feedback mechanisms forcing us to make things like the UX better,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;On the other hand, our competitors fought hard and iterated for every basis point of market share they have. We’re like that natural athlete that got to the top with natural talent, but now need to master the basics, get our form right, etc. to stay on top as the game changes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s new onboarding experience is a stab at improving this UX and Mays said the company has significant WordPress core improvements in the works to provide a better first-use experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m happy to say we’ll also be contributing these improvements back to core,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to have had Aaron Campbell join us as our first core contributor earlier this year and we&#8217;re working on more ways to accelerate our core contribution efforts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays said GoDaddy is planning to submit core contributions to the Customizer and related core components in the near future but would not disclose any specifics at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hosts benefit immensely from WordPress and as hosts we can collectively do a lot more to move WordPress forward,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;We want to lead by example here and have big plans for this in 2017.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress product and service companies are also deeply invested in the software&#8217;s success and eager to see its market share grow. Cory Miller, CEO of <a href="https://ithemes.com/" target="_blank">iThemes</a>, one of WordPress&#8217; earliest theme companies, said growth is one potential sign of WordPress&#8217; health.</p>\n<p>“As WordPress has grown, so have we with it,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;The opposite of growth is scary — it’s stagnation or decline. Many have predicted that in WordPress for a long time, but it continues to grow and push new limits, like the defiant teenager it is.”</p>\n<p>Miller said one of his concerns with competitors in the space is that they have started to cut into the lower  or lowest end of the market, &#8220;the do-it-yourselfers that many of us count as a key part of our customer base.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress is fantastic, and so are all the innovative tools and services around it, from themes, plugins to hosting,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m increasingly seeing the reason why many, on perhaps the bottom end of the market, say, &#8216;I don’t want to mess with updates, or worrying about security, or pulling 15 separate tools together to do what I need. I just want a simple website, I want everything in one bundle, mostly done for me, and so I’ll just go with SquareSpace or Weebly.''&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although WordPress provides so much more in terms of community and extensibility when compared to Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace, getting started is the hardest part for new users. This is where tools like Jetpack and GoDaddy&#8217;s onboarding experience are useful for giving users what they need to succeed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Even with a strong background in HTML and CSS, customizing a WordPress site can be challenging. Your site will never feel like your home on the web if you struggle to customize it to suit your preferences. The good news is that the WordPress project lead, contributors, hosts, and product companies are working together to improve customization in different, complementary ways in order to ensure the future of the project in an increasingly competitive market.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 22:48:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: 2nd Global WordPress Translation Day Brings 780 Translators Together Across 133 Locales";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63915";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"https://wptavern.com/2nd-global-wordpress-translation-day-brings-780-translators-together-across-133-locales";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6921:"<p>The second <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/" target="_blank">Global WordPress Translation Day</a> was held November 12 and the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2016/11/16/notes-from-the-polyglots-chats-on-november-16th/" target="_blank">stats</a> released this week show the event was an even greater success than the first one.

Xhosa is spoken by 7.6 million people, which is approximately 18% of the South African population.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Africa has a huge potential and a lot of wonderful, enthusiastic people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There will be more WordCamps there in 2017 and hopefully more activity on the translation side.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jon Bossenger and Hugh Lashbrooke, who co-organized the Cape Town event, had attendees translating WordPress into Xhosa, Sotho, and Setswana.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By the end of the day we had two translation files for these languages that we’ll be looking to submit requests to be added as locales for WordPress,&#8221; Bossenger said in his recap <a href="https://wpcapetown.co.za/2016/11/14/wordpress-global-translation-day-recap/" target="_blank">post</a>. &#8220;We’re almost halfway towards adding all 11 official languages, just in one day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trisha Cornelius, co-organizer the WP Johannesburg Meetup, organized the in-person translation event in Johannesburg where the team made major progress and assisted the Cape Town team in getting their languages started.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We managed to get Xhosa approved in time for us to translate some strings for our translation day event,&#8221; Cornelius said. &#8220;We translated into Afrikaans (which is at over 95% so we are pushing to get to 100%) and South African English as well. People who were at the Cape Town event have volunteered to become translators for Tswana and an attendee at our event has volunteered to become GTE for Zulu.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cornelius said the excitement of live streaming and connecting with Cape Town and others around the world could have easily made for an event that spanned longer than three hours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest success was in showing people how easy translation is,&#8221; Cornelius said. She hopes the translations will make WordPress easier for more people in South Africa and help more people get onto the web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;South Africa has an interesting case in that we have a clear racial split between being multi-lingual and not,&#8221; Cornelius said. &#8220;The majority of our population speaks English/Afrikaans as a second language and I would love to see WordPress available in all 11 of our official languages so that WP users can choose to use WP in their mother tongue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cornelius said language accessibility in South Africa is less of a challenge than actual access to computers with the Internet, but they are making progress in Johannesburg to make the internet more widely available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Especially with the prevalence of smart phones, I think having WordPress in more indigenous languages will mean that we are able to hear more of each others voices which we desperately need,&#8221; Cornelius said.</p>\n<p>Overall, the WordPress Translation Day participants translated a total of 60,426 strings, up from 40,350 in April. This includes popular plugins and themes in addition to WordPress core.

Visible shortcuts are an extension of the Shift-click to edit keyboard shortcut that was added in WordPress 3.9.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-63883" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?resize=1025%2C544&ssl=1" alt="Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons" /></a>Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons\n<p>The icon approach was largely inspired by WordPress.com which has a similar feature in its customizer. Nick Halsey, Customize component maintainer, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/">describes in detail</a> the history of the feature and what theme authors need to do to support it.</p>\n<p>Unlike many of the theme specific updates in the past where developers can add support by using add_theme_support, supporting visible edit shortcuts is more comprehensive. Theme authors will need to add support for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/">selective refresh</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/22/implementing-selective-refresh-support-for-widgets/">selective refresh for widgets</a>, and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/">selective refresh for menus</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Edit shortcuts will be enabled by default for all themes, but are contingent on themes supporting selective refresh,&#8221; Halsey said. Additionally, a small amount of CSS may be required to properly position the icons.</p>\n<p>Adding visual elements that connect parts of a theme to the customizer should take some of the guesswork out of editing themes. Instead of spending time browsing through various customizer panels to edit a part of a site, users can click a button and the right customizer panel will open automatically with the settings you need. This can be especially useful for themes that have a lot of customizer sections.</p>\n<p>I tested visible edit shortcuts using the Twenty Seventeen theme in WordPress 4.7 beta 4 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. The team is strongly encouraging users to test with as many themes as possible. If you use a theme where the shortcut icons are not displayed, please contact the theme author, request that they add support, and refer them to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/">the make core blog post which explains how to do so</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 08:54:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"WPTavern: Nashville to Host WordCamp US 2017-2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63871";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"https://wptavern.com/nashville-to-host-wordcamp-us-2017-2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5593:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nashville.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nashville.jpg?resize=1015%2C524&ssl=1" alt="photo credit: Viv Lynch Westward - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-63884" /></a>photo credit: Viv Lynch <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68894626@N00/30070498810">Westward</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p><a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp US</a> attendees are counting down the days until the event kicks off in Philadelphia in two weeks but preparations for 2017 and 2018 are already underway. Yesterday Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordcamp-us-2017-2018-in-nashville/" target="_blank">announced</a> that Nashville has won the bid to host WordCamp US for the next two years. According to Randy Hicks, one of the organizers, the new <a href="http://www.nashvillemusiccitycenter.com/" target="_blank">Music City Center</a> venue, which was finished in 2013, has been reserved from Thursday, November 30, 2017, to Sunday, December 3 but the camp will take place Friday &#8211; Sunday. The venue has confirmed the ability to host 3,000 &#8211; 5,000 attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a brand new venue that is pretty amazing but Nashville is very centrally located to handful of other cities that all have their own WordCamps,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;I think there are about seven camps within 4-5 hours. The WP community around Nashville is rather strong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Over the past few years the local WordPress community has grown and WordCamp Nashville sold 325 tickets at its 2016 event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been coming to the meetups since the very first one and have been an organizer since about the same time as well as John Housholder,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the community explode every year after WordCamp, but 2014 and 2015 have been huge growth years for Nashville as a whole and the meetup has reflected those numbers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The application process included nailing down a venue, creating a budget, and gathering specific details about wifi capabilities, room capabilities, hotel availability, and date availability. Organizers from both the Nashville team and the Denver team (another finalist) agreed that the application time frame was somewhat constrained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought the time frame between start and submission was pretty short, but I think that depends on who is submitting and how informed they are on their local venue,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;Ours was really hard to get information from.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Denver team had a similar struggle with locking down a venue without certainty of being able to fully book the reservation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was what I would consider to be a semi-fanatical obsession with the first weekend in December, which was flatly unavailable at the convention center here,&#8221; said Drew Jaynes, one of the organizers who applied on behalf of Denver.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To give you some perspective, at the time that we applied, March 2016, there were two available weekends left for the Colorado Convention Center &#8211; two in all of 2017. The end of August and the middle of December. To organize an event of this size on what would be considered relatively short notice for a city as popular as Denver was essentially a fool&#8217;s errand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Nashville organizing team was able to secure its venue for early December dates, but a wider range of acceptable dates might be one way for WordCamp Central to improve the process for next year. This would give more cities the opportunity to submit competitive applications, as venues that can accommodate the expected size of WCUS are in high demand in popular cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a great set of communities apply so it was tough to pick just one,&#8221; WordCamp Central representative Cami Kaos said. &#8220;In the end we went with Nashville for WordCamp US 2017-2018 because it seems like a great location for attendees, they had a beautiful venue that could accommodate an event of this size as we grow, and the dynamics between both teams were a natural fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about Nashville, the organizing team has created a <a href="http://wpnashville.com/wcus/" target="_blank">page</a> that includes some favorite local attractions and rankings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ranked within the top 10 on Cvent ’s list of Top 50 Meeting Destinations in the United States. (August 2015)</li>\n<li>Named #3 Best Convention City in the 10 Best USA Today Readers’ Choice Awards</li>\n<li>Ranked #1 Friendliest City in America by Travel and Leisure (April 2015)</li>\n<li>Listed in Collaborate Magazine’s list of the Top 12 Foodie Cities for Meetings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nashville is centrally located for a relatively short drive or flight from anywhere in the US and should have ample options for accommodation. The city won the bid to host the WordCamp out of six applicants and Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s announcement post indicates that there were multiple local communities capable of hosting the event in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on the other great applications we got I’m also excited about the pipeline of communities that could host it in future years as WordCamp US travels across the United States and gives us an opportunity to learn and love a new city, as we have with Philadelphia,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 21:50:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"HeroPress: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1490";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9579:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111616-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: If we serve the people around what we''re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop & change alongside the people we serve." /><p>My story starts in high school as a girl with a technical bent, in a small country town just as computers were becoming mainstream but well before they were in everyone’s home. (I was in high school when Apple came to school and showed off this new fangled thing they called a mouse…). We were taught BASIC and Pascal and I actually really enjoyed tinkering with programming, but no one thought to say, “Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…” I mean, I was a girl (and girls didn’t ‘DO’ computers), and no one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.</p>\n<p>The truth is I wasn’t particularly ambitious, I didn’t have any kind of clue what I wanted to be ‘when I grew up’ so I allowed myself to be gently steered by my parents into leaving school before the end of my final year when I was encouraged to apply for a job in a bank.</p>\n<p>I got the job and started in the MICR processing department, encoding cheques with magnetic text, and I finished as a teller 3 years later (and boy was I terrible at balancing the books at the end of the day &#8211; I was much better at chatting to the customers!).</p>\n<p>Financial independence was the only name of that game; for me there was very little else to recommend the job, so I saved all the money I could and took off from both the bank, and my homeland (New Zealand) in very short order as a young, naive 20 year old primed to spend the next 3 years exploring the world. And by the world, I mean the US and Europe…</p>\n<p>That first mouse had come out in 1983, WordPress was founded in 2003 and in those 20 years the world changed. While it was doing that I was at various times being a nanny, working in child care centres, working in customer support, temping, and generally &#8216;working to live&#8217; in whatever way felt right at the time. However, in 1999 I packed up my bags once again, moved from New Zealand to Australia and took a place at a performing arts school where I honed my singing and performance skills and volunteered my time to our music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And so my personal revolution began.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On what I think was the day after I graduated from that course I walked into a full time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code. It was part of my job to edit those HTML newsletters and send them out every week. I went from there to buying books about coding for the web, experimenting on my home built PC making web pages. I’m sure like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser… from there I was completely hooked.</p>\n<p>By 2004 I was working full time as a webmaster, by 2005 I was running a small business creating sites on the side of my ‘real job’ and by 2009 that small business became my full time job as I left employment to pursue my Masters Degree in Digital Communication. It was in that year I met WordPress when I moved my old Movable Type blog onto it and within a very short time I was using  WP as the CMS of choice for all my client work…</p>\n<p>Then in 2011 I stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. THAT was the thing that changed my world.</p>\n<p>I flew on a whim from Sydney to Melbourne to attend this crazy inexpensive conference I had found after a google search for ‘WordPress Conferences’. In doing so I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back to Sydney excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WP community.</p>\n<p>Building a community around WP got off to a slow start in Sydney, but from an inauspicious early WPSyd meetup in the function room of a pub (one we actually held in the dark due to a blackout) my connection and involvement took off. Before long I was helping organise that Sydney meetup and by the time I moved away from that great city it had branched into 2 meetups, and soon after, into 3. Furthermore at the end of that first year, at my second ever WordCamp, I put my hand up to help organise a WordCamp Sydney in 2012 and then as I moved interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n<p>Here’s the point.</p>\n<p>WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now…) the thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress and any other software package exists to serve people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.</p>\n<p>In organising meetups, WordCamps, and community events around WordPress,  I have found that at the end of the day it isn’t actually WordPress that matters… it’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves. Even as my career in WP has moved through coding, into team support, into project management, there too it has been the people and my connections to them in the community that have helped fuel that transition.</p>\n<p>I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself. In all of this I feel as though I’m living proof that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, I myself have been helped, resourced and connected into places I’d have never dreamed of all those years ago as a teenager playing with that first mouse… experimenting with that BASIC code.</p>\n<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger said “Help others and give something back. I guarantee you will discover that while public service improves the lives and the world around you, its greatest reward is the enrichment and new meaning it will bring your own life.” and I completely agree.</p>\n<p>Ricky Martin said “A hero is someone who is willing to help others in his or her best capacity.” Here are two very different people giving voice to exactly what I’ve found in working and serving in this great community of diverse people. This is the kind of heroism I see around WordPress, at meetups and WordCamps; it’s the kind of hero whom I want to raise up, and at the end of the day, this is the kind of hero I hope that I am.</p>\n<p>Best of all, it’s the kind of hero that absolutely ANY of us can be.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life." class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Actually%2C%20WordPress%20didn%E2%80%99t%20change%20my%20life.&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life." class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F&title=Actually%2C+WordPress+didn%E2%80%99t+change+my+life." rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life."></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111616-150x150.jpg&description=Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life." rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life."></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/" title="Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life."></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/">Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 12:00:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Dee Teal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 Beta 4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4576";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-beta-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1990:"<p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 4 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href="http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href="https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">submit it here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></i></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"WordPress 4.8.1 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/wordpress-4-8-1-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 21:26:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4875";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:366:"After over 13 million downloads of WordPress 4.8, we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of WordPress 4.8.1, a maintenance release.

Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress core’s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycle’s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core.

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8BDWH3QG-1-video" width="632" height="342" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier.

This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

(It is not available in wp-admin of self-hosted sites.) Unfortunately, this experience is still rather buggy. After adding photos, WordPress.com didn&#8217;t seem to be able to save drafts and it was also unable to display the most recent photos from the past week.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-1.44.52-PM-e1506544898526.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Users should also note that when you authenticate with Google Photos, it will open access to the photos from every single site that you have connected to that particular WordPress.com account. This access is, however, is limited to the specific user who connected. Multiple users on a site will each need to authenticate separately and can connect their own Google accounts. The users do not have access to each other&#8217;s photos. It&#8217;s also easy to revoke access at <a href="https://wordpress.com/sharing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wordpress.com/sharing</a>.</p>\n<p>The new Google Photos feature has been very well received by WordPress.com users, as it saves them the trouble of downloading images from the service and then uploading to their media libraries. It&#8217;s not quite as convenient for Jetpack-enabled sites, because it adds additional steps to the publishing process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Excellent feature, but will it be available directly from self-hosted sites without using WordPress.com?&#8221; one user asked. &#8220;This cuts out so many steps in our publishing workflow, but then adds several more if we then need to login to WordPress.com to do this. Our admin setup is complex, so switching to editing here isn’t an option. I have multiple contributors who write directly and this would be a game changer if they could directly upload their images from their account.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A WordPress.com representative confirmed that there are currently no plans to support a standalone version in Jetpack. They are, however, looking at supporting other services, such as Flickr, in the future.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 22:17:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"WPTavern: Camp Press – A Detox from Digital Life";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75139";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"https://wptavern.com/camp-press-a-detox-from-digital-life";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3381:"<p>The following is a guest post by Brad Williams who shares his experience at <a href="https://camp.press/">Camp Press</a> this past weekend. Brad is the Co-Founder and CEO of the website design and development agency <a href="https://webdevstudios.com">WebDevStudios</a>.</p>\n<p>He is also a co-author of the Professional WordPress book series. Brad is a US Marine Corps veteran and has been developing websites for over 20 years, including the last 10 where he has focused on open-source technologies like WordPress.</p>\n<hr />\n<img />Brad Williams at Camp Press\n<p>I’ve been to a number of WordCamps and tech-related events over the years. They all follow a similar pattern of speakers, panels, sponsors, after-parties, etc. We’ve all been to these types of events and generally know what to expect; so when <a href="https://twitter.com/ifyouwillit?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Mendel Kurland</a> pitched the idea of <a href="https://camp.press/">Camp Press</a> to me as &#8216;geeks camping,&#8217; I was intrigued.</p>\n<p>I went to Camp Press with no idea of what to expect. I honestly have never felt less prepared for an event as I did for this one. I like to plan. So, going to an event where I wasn’t 100% sure how it would work had me feeling nervous. What I soon realized is that I liked being pushed out of my &#8216;safety bubble.&#8217;</p>\n<p>The Camp Press location was absolutely amazing and truly helped make the event special. We stayed at a large summer camp style setup, about an hour outside of Oklahoma City called Fry Lake. If you aren’t familiar with Oklahoma, just imagine driving an hour from a large city to the middle of nowhere. Perfect.</p>\n<p>Fry Lake had cabins, shower and bathroom facilities, an amazing swimming lake with diving boards, and a full cafeteria kitchen. We were literally back at the type of summer camp we experienced as kids, and we immediately knew it.</p>\n<img />Camp Press Fire\n<p>As we learned more about each other, we quickly became more comfortable as a group. We shared stories, laughed, cooked, and debated topics from tech to TV shows. We discussed very personal struggles and experiences, some of which I would guess haven’t been shared outside of close family. We sang songs around the campfire, performed late-night improv, made s’mores, and enjoyed each other’s company.</p>\n<p>Even more amazing is that nothing was scripted. There was no agenda, set activities, presentations. It was just natural interaction. Over the course of a few days, we all grew closer to each other. There was an unspoken bond forming between everyone at Camp Press.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know what to expect going to <a href="https://camp.press/">Camp Press</a>. What I promptly learned is that was the entire point of the event—doing the unexpected, pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, making new friends, having fun and serious conversations, and doing all of this without the normal technology that is always around us.</p>\n<p>When is the last time you had a detox from digital life? My detox was last weekend, and I can’t wait to do it again!</p>\n<img />Camp Press Attendees\n<p>For more insight into Camp Press and to get Mendel&#8217;s perspective, check out the event&#8217;s <a href="https://camp.press/general/inaugural-camp-press-2017-huge-success/">official blog post</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 22:12:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"Dev Blog: Global WordPress Translation Day 3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4915";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3298:"<p><span>On September 30 2017, the WordPress Polyglots Team &#8211;

I think it was a pre-owned old beaten Compaq Deskpro 386. We only stopped arguing once we could sit down together and play Civ; one of us at the controls, the others giving advice on what moves to make.</p>\n<h3>Dipping Into The Web</h3>\n<p>I learnt HTML and built my first pages on Geocities and out of necessity: I needed a place to publish my angsty teenage poetry. But people didn’t come to my website for the bad poetry, instead they filled my guestbook with webdesign and HTML questions.</p>\n<p>I have built websites for myself and others since the mid 90’s and kept a few clients on the side while studying. At this time, there was not a lot of computer or programming classes available for high school students. It had been easy enough to learn HTML online by reading guides, message boards and similar. During one of my final semesters, my school announced a new class called “Computers for girls”. I signed up hoping to learn enough to assemble or upgrade my own PC. The class was a joke. Instead of teaching us about motherboards, memory or networks, our teacher showed us where to put the cords…</p>\n<p>He didn’t realise that most of us already spent every recess in the computer halls, chatting over IRC. In order to learn the basics of actual programming (not just HTML), I had to take adult education evening- and summer classes since my school didn’t offer any.</p>\n<h3>Derailed</h3>\n<p>After high school I did like many others of my generation: I fell in love with someone I had only met online, who lived on the other side of the world. All to the soundtrack of Savage Garden&#8217;s “I Knew I Loved You”.</p>\n<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>\n<p>It took all my savings and courage to travel back and forward between Sweden and the US, while studying from a distance.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When my boyfriend suddenly passed away in 2001 I had to make drastic changes in my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was in the middle of moving, I couldn’t keep up with deadlines or deal with clients, and I was barely able to finish my project managing and programming classes. I had to forget all our plans, start over, and take a desk job instead.</p>\n<h3>Coming Back To The Web</h3>\n<p>Many years later one of my former clients asked if I had tried WordPress. It took me a few months to decide if I liked it or not, partially because I didn’t know PHP, and because I didn’t have great experiences from trying Joomla and Drupal.</p>\n<p>I did some customization work and eventually I submitted my first theme to WordPress.org. Of course my theme was a mess and did not even work as expected.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I appreciated that someone took the time to look at my code and explain what I needed to do to fix it and where I could read more. It was very rare to receive such feedback.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I joined the Theme Review Team&#8217;s mailing list, listening in and learning. I started reviewing themes to learn more and to improve my own themes.</p>\n<p>For those who do not know what the Theme Review Team does, we test and review the code (every single file) of themes that are submitted to be included in the WordPress.org theme directory.</p>\n<h3>My Secret Power</h3>\n<p>Because I am on the autism spectrum, the structure and patterns of coding languages suits me well. I need both structure and a creative outlet in my life, and coding is therapy, much like a puzzle or a coloring book. I love my once dreaded desk job, because it gives me the opportunity to help people on a different scale than I ever could as a freelancer. Being a volunteer on WordPress.org lets me combine both worlds.</p>\n<p>I could never have imagined that WordPress would become an important part of my life, that I would spend this much time on it (sometimes up to 20 hours per week), or that I would be asked to be one of the team leads for the Theme Review Team in 2017.</p>\n<p>Today I honestly don’t know what I would do if I could no longer contribute to WordPress the way I know and am familiar with. It is an essential part of my everyday life.</p>\n<p>WordPress is also challenging because you can only do so much without interacting with others… And even though I find that difficult, I have had to learn that it is something I need as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have to remind myself from time to time that here, I am allowed to be myself, with all my flaws, to contribute as much or as little as I choose, at my own pace.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And to be able to contribute and to help others, I also have to remind myself that people are not scary.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>I was a volunteer online for 6 years before I had the courage to go to my first WordCamp, which took place in my own home town. When I was finally there, I only spoke to 3 or 4 people. My second WordCamp went better, but the experience was still overwhelming.</p>\n<p>During my third WordCamp, which was WCEU 2017, I helped lead the Theme Review section of the contributor day, having to speak in front of 500 people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The thing is, even when it overwhelms you, this community and its energy is addicting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Everything changes once you go to your first meetup or WordCamp, meeting people who share your interest and passion. The community at large is open and welcoming, passionate, curious and caring. And it is trying to be a safe place for us all.</p>\n<h3>The Theme Review Team</h3>\n<p>There always seem to be a lot of opinions and even controversy surrounding the Theme Review Team. It is not always easy to handle the pressure and the amount of responsibility that is placed on you because so many people have a financial interest in WordPress themes. As a team lead or moderator, you often have to try to find the least bad solution to many different kind of situations.</p>\n<p>By the end of September, it is time for the current team leads to step back and welcome our next leads. I am looking forward to the break, but also to see what new ideas they will bring.<br />\nIt takes time to change a system that has been in place for this many years, and truthfully, sometimes it is painfully slow. It has proven difficult to find a system where themes without errors can be added to the directory quickly, and where reviewers can support authors who need extra help.</p>\n<p>This amazing team of volunteers has managed to reduce the queue time from 7 months down to 8-10 weeks.

The discussion focused less on specific framework comparisons and more on the role a framework will play in building JavaScript-powered interfaces for WordPress. Contributors were joined by core developers and leaders from the React and Vue communities, Chrome engineers, and other interested parties from outside the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This chat will focus largely on identifying requirements in building core features, overlap with plugin and theme authors, and patterns to reducing framework lock-in,&#8221; Duthie said. &#8220;Ideally this is higher-level than simply debating the merits of specific frameworks in a vacuum, and should be seen as an opportunity to collaborate between projects to set a path forward for WordPress which will provide flexibility and resiliency to future churn.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Duthie began by asking what role a framework should play in a WordPress developer&#8217;s workflow and also asked framework contributors to offer their perspectives on recommendations for extendable interfaces. This question provided attendees with the opportunity to weigh in on topics such as <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2791" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support for web components</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">framework-agnostic block interoperability</a> for Gutenberg, and how this might affect WordPress&#8217; plugin ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I disagree a bit with the idea that whatever core (in this case Gutenberg) uses to power some of the intricacies of building a stateful app is going to be the de facto standard for plugin development,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Matías Ventura said. &#8220;The actual framework here, in general terms, is going to be what WordPress exposes and the APIs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks, the library that core decides to build on doesn&#8217;t have to become the de facto standard for plugin developers but many outside the Gutenberg team believe that it will inevitably end up that way in practice. There are entire teams of engineers waiting on this decision that are committed to adopt whichever framework WordPress bets on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To provide some perspective on how WP’s decision on a framework impacts developers downstream, I’m a developer at Boston University and our plan is to focus on whichever framework WP decides upon, even if Gutenberg has a completely agnostic API,&#8221; Adam Pieniazek said. &#8220;We’re primarily a WP shop (~ 1,000 site WP install powers most/a lot of our public web presence) and end up creating huge customizations on top of WP that often require diving into core to see what is actually happening in the background. I like Vue more than React personally, but if WP decides upon React, BU will focus on building expertise in React for when we need to peek/debug beyond the API. It doesn’t mean we won’t also use Vue but it won’t be our primary focus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pieniazek feedback echoes that of Gravity Forms co-founder Carl Hancock, who said his team is ready to adopt whatever library WordPress selects.</p>\n<p>“People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,” Hancock said in the #core-js channel earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Many participants from outside the WordPress community seemed to be in agreement with a framework-agnostic approach and none were eager to force a single framework on all developers working with WordPress. The remaining concern is how this works out practically and whether it puts developers in the confusing position of using a framework on top of a framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since Gutenberg itself is going to become a platform to build for, the best level of separation is if the framework is used to build the core, but isn’t exposed as API to block builders,&#8221; AMP engineer Paul Bakaus said. &#8220;This gives one the choice to replace the underlying foundation whenever necessary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella summarized the approach the team has been discussing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think what we try to communicate is something like:</p>\n<p>&#8211; WordPress Core is going to use this X framework internally<br />\n &#8211; If you want to use it, we think it’s good<br />\n &#8211; If you want to use something else, you can just as easily as you’d use the Core’s chosen framework</p></blockquote>\n<p>Benguella also said that one of the goals for Gutenberg is &#8220;to set the basis for how we extend WordPress&#8217; UI in the future.&#8221; Once it ships, the team will likely set its sights on other parts of the wp-admin and build them in the same way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If all parts of WP’s UI can be extended via a standard interface, whether it be a simple &#8216;data down, events up&#8217; API, or expecting a WC, I think this would cleanly separate the concerns of &#8216;what framework to use for core&#8217; vs. &#8216;what framework to use for extension development,''&#8221; Vue.js creator Evan You said.</p>\n<p>When asked for his thoughts on on React becoming a primary framework for WordPress, React maintainer Dan Abromov was hesitant to advocate for WordPress adopting the library. His response underscored the necessity of having a framework-agnostic approach for extending Gutenberg and future WP interface overhauls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know WordPress well, so it&#8217;s hard for me to say whether it&#8217;s a great fit for the use case or not,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;Generally we use React for highly interactive UIs and find that it scales well with the app size. I&#8217;m also happy to answer technical questions about it. But I think in general people have strong opinions about, for example, templating vs expressiveness, and I don&#8217;t feel like forcing React upon everyone is the best way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also feel the same way,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;Forcing a single framework on everyone, regardless of which one, is IMO not a good idea because it is bound to alienate the group of devs who are not into that framework, and imposes a bigger long term stability risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also said that people are already &#8220;very bitter and divisive&#8221; about the subject of selecting a framework. He also tweeted a similar sentiment prior to the meeting.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I read discussion threads (e.g. about WordPress) there’s a sense that people perceive every team as hostile to others.

It’s just a matter of proper implementation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants referenced <a href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">custom-elements-everywhere.com</a>, a site that displays popular JS frameworks&#8217; progress on communicating Custom Elements in a way that promotes interoperability. Matías Ventura asked React and Vue core devs how web components (and their future) fit into each framework at the moment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In React, we have some web component support but haven&#8217;t made it a large priority since use cases have seemed slim in the past, especially since adding Web Components hasn&#8217;t made a lot of sense in a first-party application where you control the whole stack – but we do have some support for them nonetheless and I&#8217;m happy to entertain adding more, either now or in the future,&#8221; Sophie Alpert said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the high level I think frameworks like React/Vue provide what is not really addressed in web components: efficient and declarative DOM updates reacting to state changes,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;This is also why Polymer exists on top of WC. I have always acknowledged the value of WC as an interop interface.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Overall, attendees at the meeting were respectful, collaborative, and eager to contribute their expertise to help WordPress contributors find the best way forward in the framework selection process. The discussion will continue at next week&#8217;s meeting and likely in the comments of a forthcoming Make/Core post summarizing the meeting.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 22:16:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Spam Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75059";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"https://wptavern.com/si-captcha-anti-spam-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-og-due-to-spam-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4092:"<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam</a> plugin has been removed from the WordPress Directory due to its author including spam code. The plugin added a CAPTCHA image test to WordPress forms to prevent spam and was compatible with forms generated by bbPress, BuddyPress, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. It had more than 300,000 active installs at the time of removal.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikechallis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mike Challis</a>, the original author of the plugin, said that a WordPress.org user named &#8220;<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/fastsecure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fastsecure</a>&#8221; became the new owner of SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam in June 2017. Challis was not aware of the new owner&#8217;s plans for the plugin but <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted a notice</a> on the WordPress.org support forums to inform users about why it was removed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new owner attempted to put code in several of his newly acquired WordPress plugins that would connect to a 3rd party server he also owned and place spam ads for payday loans and such in the WP posts,&#8221; Challis said. He also linked the incident to a ring of WordPress plugins that researchers at Wordfence say were part of a <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/09/coordinated-plugin-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">coordinated spam campaign</a>. Display Widgets, one of the most notable plugins in this group, was recently <a href="https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code" rel="noopener" target="_blank">permanently removed from WordPress.org</a> for a series of violations wherein the author had injected malicious code.</p>\n<p>Challis said the new owner failed to display any spam on sites due to how the code was implemented, but the code could have been activated at a later time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The new owner put spam code in versions 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 but it failed to display any spam because he put the code in the secureimage.php file. The malicious code required WordPress libraries to also be loaded to execute. The reason the spam code did not do anything at all is because the secureimage.php file is not included in the WordPress run time environment. The secureimage.php file is included from another file securimage_show.php that loads the captcha image directly from html img src outside of the WordPress run time. The spam code in this plugin was never activated, it would not have corrupted your posts or changed anything in the WordPress database.</p></blockquote>\n<p>SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam users who still have the plugin installed may see an update available in the WordPress admin. Plugin team member Samuel (Otto) Wood removed the malicious code and <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released 3.0.3</a> as a clean version that is a safe update for users who still rely on the plugin. Wood recommends users find an alternative, because SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam will not be re-listed in the directory or receive any future updates.</p>\n<p>The incident is another reminder for users to be on alert when WordPress.org plugins change hands, as the buyers do not always disclose their actual intentions for the plugin.

React community members began rallying around a <a href="https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">petition to re-license React</a> after the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) added Facebook’s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses for Apache PMC members. Facebook’s engineering directors officially denied the request in mid-August, citing the burden of meritless patent litigation as the reason for keeping the patents clause.</p>\n<p>Facebook moved forward on this decision in full recognition that it might lose some React community members as a consequence. Many open source project maintainers began to look for alternatives. In a surprising move, Matt Mullenweg announced that <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WordPress would also be parting ways with React</a> and planned to remove it from the upcoming Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s decision to drop React from consideration for WordPress was likely an influential factor in Facebook&#8217;s eventual about-face on the topic of re-licensing the project. Facebook&#8217;s announcement on Friday acknowledges that the company failed to convince the open source community of the benefits of its BSD + Patents license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re relicensing these projects because React is the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source software for the web, and we don&#8217;t want to hold back forward progress for nontechnical reasons. </p>\n<p>This decision comes after several weeks of disappointment and uncertainty for our community. Although we still believe our BSD + Patents license provides some benefits to users of our projects, we acknowledge that we failed to decisively convince this community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The React 16 release, slated for this week, will ship with the updated MIT license. Facebook declined to respond to our request for further comment and said their post is the only public statement they will be providing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear whether WordPress will continue on with React, picking up where the team left off on Gutenberg, or  shift to another library. Core contributors had originally <a href="https://twitter.com/nacin/status/911356481936740352" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decided on React</a> while attending WordPress&#8217; community summit in Paris last June, although this decision had not yet been made public when the greater open source community started petitioning Facebook to re-license React.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m just so tired of this drama,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella said. &#8220;We spent days and days thinking about the best framework for WP, and this change will just add more thinking, complexity, and uncertainty to our decision. I’m just tired of all this&#8230;we all have to rethink everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg, who had previously penned a several-thousand word unpublished announcement about how WordPress would be adopting React, did not confirm whether WordPress is still examining other libraries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our decision to move away from React, based on their previous stance, has sparked a lot of interesting discussions in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/09/facebook-dropping-patent-clause/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> published to his blog this weekend. &#8220;Particularly with Gutenberg there may be an approach that allows developers to write Gutenberg blocks (Gutenblocks) in the library of their choice including Preact, Polymer, or Vue, and now React could be an officially-supported option as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The regularly scheduled core JavaScript meeting is set for Tuesday, September 26 at 15:00 GMT and contributors plan to discuss the role a JS framework will play in current and future core focuses.

I watched a presentation where the presenter had slides with 20+ different recommended tools on them, and not a single mention of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an eCommerce conference, WooCommerce is 41% of all eCommerce stores, and not a single person said the word WooCommerce. All I heard about was Shopify and Amazon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to <a href="https://www.similartech.com/">SimilarTech</a>, WooCommerce is leading in the top 100K sites, top 1M sites, and the entire web while Shopify is leading in the top 10K sites. While Shopify has a lot less market share, it&#8217;s used on substantially higher trafficked sites.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared the perspective of a friend who uses Shopify to sell clothing and will gross more than $1M in revenue this year. According to his friend, Shopify is easy to use, from setting up a theme, to the plugin/app ecosystem to add functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When my friend said Shopify is easy to use, this is a whole different category of great user experience,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;This is building a site from scratch for a completely non-technical user, and them loving the end result and the experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bolinger raised an interesting point in that, Wix, Shopify, and SquareSpace are closed, SaaS offerings where they can control the user experience from end-to-end. This is impossible to do with WordPress because there are too many moving parts and core can not control how plugins and themes take part in that experience.</p>\n<p>While WordPress core can&#8217;t necessarily solve the problem, it hasn&#8217;t stopped webhosts from trying. <a href="https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-new-onboarding-experience-for-wordpress-customers">GoDaddy</a>,  <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/blog/bluehost-news/welcome-to-the-new-bluehost-8973/">Bluehost</a>, and others have created onboarding solutions that try to control the end-to-end user experience.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared a sentiment that many in the WordPress community have advocated in recent years. &#8220;If we’re honest, the strength of WordPress is not that it’s easy to use for non-technical people. It’s an open-source platform that is easy for developers to extend and customize for clients.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://mattreport.com/wordpress-is-not-easy/">WordPress is Not Easy</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://mor10.com/wordpress-easy-thats-ok/">WordPress is not easy – and that’s OK</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://neliosoftware.com/blog/is-wordpress-as-easy-as-we-think/">Is WordPress As Easy As We Think?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There was a time, somewhere between WordPress 2.3 and WordPress 3.5, where one of the main reasons people used WordPress was because it was easy. Between then and now, what caused WordPress to lose its ease-of-use factor?</p>\n<p>SquareSpace, Wix, and Shopify didn&#8217;t exist in the early days of WordPress, they were late to market. This gave them the advantage of implementing all the lessons learned through WordPress&#8217; lifespan and since it&#8217;s a closed system, they can iterate rapidly.</p>\n<p>The biggest reality check that Bolinger shares is that there are a lot of people WordPress simply doesn&#8217;t cater too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is a large contingent of people who just want to get stuff done, they don’t want to fuss with the tech&#8221;, He said. &#8220;They don’t care about open source or owning their data. They don’t want to install a theme and setup their widgets, or search thousands of results to find the best SEO plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They don’t want to set up &#8216;managed hosting&#8217;, an SSL certificate, or a payment gateway.

One of the more recent topics is the possibility of <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">framework-agnostic block rendering</a> for Gutenberg, which would allow developers to extend the new editor using any JS library they prefer. This means that Gutenberg blocks, which are colloquially referred to as &#8220;Gutenblocks,&#8221; could be built with Vue, React, Preact, Angular, or whatever the developer feels comfortable using.</p>\n<p>Proponents of this idea contend that pursuing a more flexible approach makes WordPress&#8217; core JS framework decision <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463#issuecomment-330637007" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less critical</a>. While answering questions on the #core-js channel, Gary Pendergast explained how Gutenberg could be built to maintain the separation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really not joking when I say that this decision doesn&#8217;t matter, even for people contributing to Gutenberg,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;In <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#2463</a>, the library is treated entirely as a utility library, much like we use lodash, for example. It performs a handful of tasks, and it can be relatively easily pulled out and replaced with something entirely different, with no disruption to the rest of the codebase. For people contributing to Gutenberg, they&#8217;re contributing in the Gutenberg coding style, not the style of whatever library we happen to import.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked about a timeline for when the decision will be made and what factors are being considered, Pendergast replied that there is no timeline and that those interested in participating should blog about their experiences and write examples of things they can build with the JS frameworks they are familiar with.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is neither roadmap, nor timeline, nor does there need to be,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;As Matt mentioned, it&#8217;s really just a technical decision &#8211; the important decision for the wider community was choosing &#8216;not React.&#8217; Unfortunately, this decision has been blown way out of proportion, and heavily conflated with &#8216;what JS library will I be able to build my plugins with?&#8217; and sometimes &#8216;what JS library&#8217;s practices will Gutenberg blocks resemble?,&#8217; neither of which are related. Tweets and posts that treat it like a horse race are not helpful in this way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast said whatever library is selected will &#8220;continue to be wrapped by the WordPress element, the underlying library won&#8217;t be exposed.&#8221; The Gutenberg team is working to remove all library dependencies from its components so that plugin developers can use any library they choose.</p>\n<p>However, other community members are not so eager to relegate the JS library selected for core to a simple technical decision or utility library.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most developers understand that their plugins are not bound by the framework chosen for core/Gutenberg,&#8221; Kevin Hoffman said. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t diminish the significance of the decision. If we want to encourage more contributors, we&#8217;d be well served to choose a framework in which a significant majority feel capable and confident. If this majority is out there developing plugins with one framework and has to learn another in order to contribute to core, then we&#8217;re limiting the number of potential contributors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Peter Booker contends that no matter how elegant Gutenberg&#8217;s separation is, having a decent understanding of the library chosen for core affects a developers&#8217; ability to deeply troubleshoot certain issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do not think we should be so dismissive of the choice as a minor technical decision,&#8221; Booker said. &#8220;Understanding how PHP, JavaScript, and Backbone (among other things) work is essential to be able to properly debug problems with WordPress. The JS framework chosen for Gutenberg is going to impact a great many people, even if we are not core contributors. It will be essential knowledge to be able to fully troubleshoot issues. This is a decision which will impact far more people than just the Gutenberg team.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What are the implications of providing a flexible, framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks?</h3>\n<p>Jason Bahl asked if anyone has tried mixing React, Preact, Vue, and Angular in a single app to see if it is &#8220;a recipe for a performance nightmare.&#8221; He posed an example scenario wherein Gravity Forms builds Vue-based Gutenblocks, Yoast has React-based blocks, WooCommerce builds blocks with Preact, and another plugin uses Ember.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It sounds kind of nice to be flexible and allow folks to use whatever but also like it could lead to a lot of division on best practices, and potentially performance issues,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see tutorials pop up for how to build Gutenblocks in Vue, React, Preact, Ember, Vanilla JS, etc., which would be cool to see, but also confusing and potentially cause further divide in the community and accepted best practices. Flexibility is nice to a degree, but a strong opinion at some level is also good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Carl Hancock, co-founder of Gravity Forms, contends that offering a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks will have little influence on developers who are extending the project. The decision cannot be made less critical by offering more flexibility, because developers will inevitably adopt whatever WordPress core uses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;Which means however complex that core framework ends up being will have a direct impact on the barrier to entry for plugin and theme developers. That barrier to entry has been historically low to date and a direct contributor to the growth of WordPress as a self-hosted CMS. Dramatically raising that barrier to entry isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For example, Gravity Forms will use Preact, Vue, whatever, because we have the manpower and skillset to do so when we can finally decide to do so once core makes it’s decision.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217; Opportunity to Advance the Web</h3>\n<p>WordPress currently powers 28% of all websites, according to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" rel="noopener" target="_blank">W3 Techs</a>, and whatever framework it chooses will make a major impact on which library many developers decide to learn in order to extend the software and advance their careers.</p>\n<p>Matías Ventura, one of the technical leads on the Gutenberg project, encouraged participants in the discussion to look at the bigger picture and embrace the opportunity to work together and collaborate on a solution for WordPress that will advance the web. The team&#8217;s efforts to collaborate with representatives from competing frameworks stands apart in an ecosystem that is generally fragmented and fractious.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m excited about the opportunity we have to advance web development in terms of JavaScript UI representation, in a similar way to how WordPress was a driving force for web standards during the past decade,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;That’s also where I see us having a responsibility as a project, as people will continue to learn web development through WP. Many people have been introduced to PHP through WordPress, originally just interacting with WP functions and APIs, eventually diving a bit more deeply into the language as needed. I do see our core remaining close to JS the language, as that gives the most meaningful tool to learn, spanning across all frameworks and libraries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura assured participants in the ongoing discussion that the Gutenberg team is listening and working towards a solution that will push the web forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are absolutely aware that how we build and what we offer through Gutenberg is going to affect the dev community and we are not taking this lightly—quite the opposite,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;I’ve been talking with Evan (Vue) and Jason (Preact) because rather than having a &#8216;choose your framework&#8217; contest, this seems an opportunity to collaborate and push the web forwards.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 22:26:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"WPTavern: DonateWC Reaches Fundraising Goal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=75001";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"https://wptavern.com/donatewc-reaches-fundraising-goal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1702:"<p><a href="https://donatewc.org/">DonateWC</a>, <a href="https://wptavern.com/donatewc-aims-to-provide-travel-sponsorships-to-attend-large-wordcamps">an initiative</a> focused on providing less fortunate people an opportunity to attend large WordCamps has <a href="https://donatewc.org/news/surprise-our-goal-is-fully-funded/">reached its fundraising goal</a> of 1,000€.

The event was designed for people who use WordPress to manage publications and also to encourage collaboration among project maintainers who build open source tools for publishers.</p>\n<p>In addition to hands-on technical workshops, the <a href="https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/schedule/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">schedule</a> included a variety of publishing-related topics, such as monetization, content distribution, newsletter tools, and print and digital workflows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The schedule prompted a great deal of learning and discussion that extended well beyond the content typically found at a regional WordCamp,&#8221; attendee Maura Teal <a href="https://mlteal.com/2017/08/wordcamp-publishers-denver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;One of the best aspects of this conference was chatting with other developers and leaders involved in media on the web. There were multiple sessions and hallway discussions that brought intriguing solutions to the table. My primary takeaway was that there certainly needs to be more WordCamps of this kind &#8211; that is, focused on a niche but still rooted in community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The unique format of the event offered more small group opportunities than a traditional WordCamp does for learning, asking questions, and collaborating around tools and strategies that directly relate to publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp for Publishers was not your average or typical WordCamp,&#8221; attendee Dwayne McDaniel <a href="https://www.mcdwayne.com/2017/08/21/wordcamp-for-publishers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;It felt a lot more like WPCampus insofar as the general mood and feeling I got from the participants. Getting to see folks from competing media companies openly discussing how to solve their common challenges, I learned a whole lot and I am grateful to have had the chance to learn about the publishing space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Videos for all of the sessions held in the auditorium are now available in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4P7UHKK-kC1CGF3LDtfPDwtLEzDKiP9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube playlist</a>.

WordPress 4.8 added the new audio, image, and video widgets from this feature plugin. The gallery widget is targeted for merge into the upcoming WordPress 4.9 release.</p>\n<p>In testing the new feature I found it to be a simple, straightforward implementation of a gallery widget that could easily replace many plugins that are currently filling this need for users. The option to edit or replace a gallery is immediately available and users can easily rearrange or randomize the images included.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/core-gallery-widget.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>On the frontend the gallery displays neatly in a thumbnail grid. I was able to change the number of columns while editing the gallery, but the preview in the admin did not match the the way the gallery looks on the frontend. The number of columns is correct on the frontend but not in the admin preview. This might cause some confusion for users if it isn&#8217;t fixed before landing in core. Contributors to the plugin are looking at this <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/issues/190#issuecomment-331011895" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issue</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-20-at-3.16.22-PM-e1505938641908.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Overall, the implementation is user-friendly and similar to adding galleries in posts and pages. However, the widget could still use some testing, especially with different plugins installed. For example, with Jetpack enabled, users can choose between a thumbnail and a slideshow gallery, but the slideshow option doesn&#8217;t seem to work correctly in the widget. WordPress.org has <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/gallery+widget/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">several hundred plugins</a> that implement some sort of gallery widget and these plugin authors will want to test the new core widget.</p>\n<p>Theme authors will also need to test how the core gallery widget interacts with their themes. After testing the gallery widget with several popular WordPress.org themes, I found that many display the thumbnails with unsightly outlines and unpredictable spacing between images.</p>\n<p>Weston Ruter, who authored the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dev note post</a> when the previous media widgets were introduced in 4.8, said that the paragraph regarding default theme updates is still applicable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Themes that add custom styles to the MediaElement.js player (namely Twenty Thirteen and Twenty Fourteen) were updated from just styling it within syndicated content, to also include instances within widgets. Most themes don’t restrict styles for captioned images or media players to just post content, that is, limit CSS selectors to classes output by post_class(). If your theme does, make sure to either remove that constraint or include a .widget selector.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ruter said another dev note will be coming with common theme changes that are required to add the right styling for galleries. Users and theme/plugin developers can test the gallery widget right now on 4.8.2 or 4.9-alpha using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin. Once the widget is added to WordPress, it will be deactivated in the feature plugin for future releases. Contributors plan to merge the new widget into core next week, provided testing goes well.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 00:35:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 288 – No React.js Framework for Gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=74933&preview=true&preview_id=74933";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-288-no-react-js-framework-for-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3046:"<p>While I was supposed to be on vacation last week, I instead had surgery for a broken ankle.

I had become a part of something bigger than myself." /><p>The first time I ever made a WordPress site, I got 180,000 views in 2 days, 253 comments, and (give or take) 7 death threats.</p>\n<p>It was 2014 and I was working on an MBA at Florida State University during the peak of the Jameis Winston controversy, where a football quarterback was accused of rape and protected from prosecution by the university and local police. I had used WordPress before, but not a lot. But, in true democratizing publishing, giving a voice to the voiceless fashion, when I had something I wanted to say, I knew just the thing to get it out there with minimal know-how: a free, single page WordPress.com site.</p>\n<p>I had just returned to Florida from a summer in New York City. To my amazement, I got the life-changing opportunity, paid for by the university’s College of Social Sciences paid, to go up there for a summer of exploration in the social entrepreneurship and technology circles after pitching Florida State on a concept for financial education.</p>\n<h3>Beginning the Journey</h3>\n<p>I had become interested in financial education around the age of 16, when my family became homeless for a month. My mom hadn’t been able to make the rent, so we got kicked out, and then couldn’t find an apartment easily due to my mom’s lack of credit. Later, I started working at a major commercial bank and met hundreds, if not thousands, of people in similar situations (and saw the ways in which major commercial banks don’t help these people, but that’s a different conversation).</p>\n<p>Imagine having been homeless at 16. Then, 6 years later, you’re attending graduate school, funded by the university, and that same university also paid for you to live in the country’s most expensive place for 3 months so that you could learn about executing your ideas on how to make a positive difference through technology entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>You would probably be overcome with gratefulness. But you would also likely be extremely protective of the people making such a thing possible.</p>\n<p>Now imagine, that while Florida State University’s programs making such an impact on you, a football player’s actions are driving the narrative of this place you want to be proud of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine me, telling the story I just told you, and watching people connect the dots between what institution was making all of this possible for me, and what they had heard of it. “Oh, my God, with the quarterback that raped that girl?” they would say.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would link you to the page I created, but quite honestly, it wasn’t a lot more than a profanity-laden rant (of admittedly epic proportions). But, it got a reaction: she needs to shut the f**k up. She’s completely right. She’s an “attention-seeking whore!”. She’s the story we should be focusing on. She’s just upset her Kickstarter campaign failed.</p>\n<p>There it was: WordPress had amplified my voice, and everyone else’s, too.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress Business</h3>\n<p>Today, I’m the lesser-known half of Caldera Labs, makers of Caldera Forms, a top drag-and-drop form building plugin for WordPress. A few weeks ago, we got a one-star review on WordPress.org that called me out by name: “their team is useless, especially Christie Chirinos.” I received caring notes from several seasoned WordPress product developers, reassuring me that these things happen and I ought to not take it personally. “It’s not the first time someone’s been mean to me on the internet, and it probably won’t be the last,” I wrote in a Slack DM to my incredible business partner, the part of Caldera Labs you probably know, Josh Pollock. Josh laughed.</p>\n<p>My road from single-page rants on WordPress.com to WordPress product leadership was actually pretty straightforward, although certainly wrapped in incredible fortune. I kept up that blog for a few months at the request of some of those 253 people (and the dismay of some others). Eventually it was forgotten for my financial education project’s website, which went from Wix to self-hosted WordPress.</p>\n<p>Some months of working on that site made me acutely aware that if I wanted to execute more of my ideas, I should learn more code. I started learning JavaScript and PHP. I met Josh somewhere around that time. He liked my WordPress.com story, and encouraged me to keep learning, while picking my brain on what my almost-finished MBA thought about Caldera Forms.</p>\n<p>A professor asked me if I would work on his academic WordPress website for a fee. I was a broke graduate student, so I said yes. Suddenly I had clients. When I graduated, Josh approached me with a proposal to join him in business. I said yes, but my only condition is that I’m moving back to New York City. Josh said, remote work is the norm.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2118" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen_shot_2017-09-19_at_8.26.20_pm-1024x374.png" alt="Screen shot of Caldera website" width="960" height="351" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the quote-unquote “formal business education,” I was flabbergasted when the full weight of what a WordPress product business entailed hit me. I didn’t understand the community. I didn’t understand the niche’s culture. Much of what I learned were business norms, were completely non-existent in WordPress. I communicated all of this to Josh.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I have no idea what I’m doing.”</p>\n<p>“Of course you don’t, you’ve never done this before.”</p>\n<p>He introduced me to the extensive library of talks on WordPress TV on imposter syndrome.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Diving Into WordCamp</h3>\n<p>For me, it clicked at the inaugural WordCamp US. I showed up to the event looking like a deer caught in the headlights and was welcomed with open arms. I got to put faces to all of the names I had learned in the last half-year, and surprise: they were nice. They were welcoming. They were understanding.</p>\n<p>I scoffed at the idea that I would have anything to contribute on Contributor Day, and then found out that the polyglots team could totally use an immigrant that speaks 4 languages. More importantly, I became completely inspired by the mission of WordPress. I realized that, by total accident (or perhaps completely on purpose), I had become a part of something bigger than myself. I had to stick with it, no matter how hard it was.</p>\n<p>In the year after that, I also began to find a small niche for myself. I became “the girl with the MBA,” smart, young, and clearly lucky. “There’s not a lot of people in the space with your background,” said the host interviewing me on a WordPress podcast. Meanwhile, I’m thinking to myself, “oh my god. I don’t even understand why you invited me. I’m very grateful, but I also really don’t know that much about business. Didn’t you notice? Didn’t anyone tell you?”</p>\n<p>Move forward a year, and results started rolling in. I spoke at 4 WordCamps and many other shows. Josh published his 2016 Year In Review, where he outlined the explosive growth that Caldera Forms experienced at the end of the year and acknowledged the benefit of having partnered with me. He doesn’t know this, but I cried when I read that (now he knows).</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was surreal: the unlikely thing that we set out to do was working.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This year, 2017, has consisted of taking on the next step in that process: teaching myself how to turn all of those thoughts on their heads. I have had to unlearn “why me?” and internalize “why not me?”, and most importantly, practice differentiating the story that I tell myself about myself versus the evidence-based reality.</p>\n<h3>Self Discovery</h3>\n<p>A crucial part of this stage has been learning that what I do does not define who I am. That’s a tired joke where I live. The joke goes that you can go to any bar, and participate in the same script: what’s your name? What do you do? “I’m Christie, and I’m a partner and the business manager at a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” is a story, and it immediately sparks self-doubt. That isn’t an answer that describes an evidence-based reality, it is an answer that describes a story, and stories by definition require effort to be believed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Who I am, I am learning, is the collection of my experiences, which then drive my priorities in how I do what I do, which is business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In that podcast interview, I wasn’t told “there aren’t many business managers in the space.” I was told that there weren’t a lot of people with my background in the space. It’s the collection of my stories &#8211; of immigration, difficult childhoods, arguments in business school classrooms and accidentally viral WordPress websites, that perfectly positioned me to do what I’m doing right now.</p>\n<p>The main reason I wanted to write for HeroPress when Topher offered was to take these thoughts out of my story. The more I grow into this role, the more I’m learning that this is especially common with people like me.</p>\n<p>Research is being conducted more and more every day seeking to discover why we don’t become entrepreneurs who fearlessly pursue happiness and high-risk, high-reward situations (the common trope being that privilege is being told to strive to be anything one wants to be, while others are told to strive for an escape from instability).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most of it boils down to the idea that many minorities, women, immigrants, people from low-income households &#8211; take your pick &#8211; have convinced themselves of a story that does not, in fact, reflect the reality of their possibilities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s a shame, because there’s almost as much research that demonstrates that businesses with diverse leadership teams outperform homogeneous teams almost every single time.</p>\n<p>Let’s start talking about this, even if this isn’t something that directly relates to you. Because, if that is the case, chances are that this is a topic that relates to someone you know. Diversity of thought is an important part of our WordPress community narrative. If you are not the person who must assess replacing a story with an evidence-based reality, you may be someone who is positioned to engage in powerful actions to promote diversity of thought, like encouraging someone else to challenge the stories they tell themselves and the stories they tell others about themselves. “I’m Christie, and I lead all of the business development and marketing for a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” sounds a lot better.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=What%20I%20Do%20Does%20Not%20Define%20Who%20I%20Am&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F&title=What+I+Do+Does+Not+Define+Who+I+Am" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/092017-150x150.jpg&description=What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/" title="What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/">What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 12:00:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Christie Chirinos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.2 Patches Eight Security Vulnerabilities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74914";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-2-patches-eight-security-vulnerabilities";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:840:"<p>WordPress 4.8.2 <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/">is available for download</a> and users are encouraged to update as soon as possible.

Version 3.2 is on track to make the process of updating stores a smoother experience with a long-awaited new feature that displays version compatibility checks to users prior to updating their extensions.</p>\n<p>Many WooCommerce store owners experienced considerable difficulties in updating to version 3.0 due to incompatibilities with extensions that were not fully compatible. The widespread problems with updating caused a direct hit to the plugin&#8217;s reputation, even though the main issue was with third-party extensions not being ready to go for 3.0. WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s new pre-update extension version checks will help users to be more informed about the status of extension compatibility before updating.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce plugin developers can now add two new headers to their extensions to specify a minimum required version and a &#8220;tested up to&#8221; version.<br />\n<code><br />\n/*<br />\n * Plugin Name: WooCommerce Barter Gateway<br />\n * Plugin URI: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-barter/<br />\n * Description: Take payments by bartering crops and livestock.<br />\n * Author: WooCommerce<br />\n * Author URI: https://woocommerce.com/<br />\n * Version: 3.0.7<br />\n * Text Domain: woocommerce-gateway-barter<br />\n * Domain Path: /languages<br />\n * WC requires at least: 3.0.0<br />\n * WC tested up to: 3.2.0<br />\n */</code></p>\n<p>Plugin authors are recommended to update these headers after each major and minor WooCommerce release. (Patch releases do not require headers to be updated.)</p>\n<p>The core WooCommerce plugin will check through the extension headers and display a warning to users when updates are available, detailing which plugins have or haven&#8217;t been tested with the latest major version.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pre-update-extension-version-checks.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WooCommerce developer Claudiu Lodromanean cited several important benefits for extension developers in a <a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing the new feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will have to field fewer complaints from users that the new WooCommerce version broke your plugin. They will have clear warnings about the dangers of upgrading when the plugin is incompatible. This should reduce your support load when new versions of WooCommerce are released.</li>\n<li>You will not have to rush updates to your plugin. If a user upgrades WooCommerce and your plugin breaks you are under a lot of pressure to release an update fast. If the user waits until a compatible version of the plugin is released before updating WooCommerce you do not have this problem.</li>\n<li>Users will trust your plugin more. By adding the header you are letting the user know that the plugin has been tested, works with their version of WooCommerce, and is actively maintained to be compatible with WooCommerce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The pre-update version checks for extensions is an exciting improvement for store owners and the greater WooCommerce developer community. Updates will be much easier when users can see at a glance which of their extensions are ready to go. Developers are also <a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/#comment-3635" target="_blank">interested in seeing this feature applied for themes</a> and the WooCommerce team confirmed they will look into the possibility.</p>\n<p><a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/important-update-woocommerce-3-2-will-now-be-released-october-11th/" target="_blank">WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s release date</a> has been pushed back one week to October 11 to give store owners and extension developers enough time to test.

As Vue is once again among the leading contenders, I reached out to Vue.js creator Evan You to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress adopting the framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, I had a conversation with the WordPress team mostly answering questions they had about Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;The discussion happened before Matt&#8217;s announcement of moving away from React. It was mostly intended for filling the team in with the state of Vue and there was no particular conclusion made from it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I got the feeling that the team had already decided to go with React and simply wanted to explore other options before they make the final call. I was a bit surprised by Matt&#8217;s post, but also understand the concerns behind that decision. I think React is a technically sound choice, and the whole patent issue is unfortunate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vue is back in the mix alongside Preact.js and other libraries WordPress core contributors are considering adopting. You has been active in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/31/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-30th/#comment-32642" target="_blank">comments</a> on the WordPress core development blog during the previous discussion, as well as more recently in the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733#issuecomment-330124938" target="_blank">discussion</a> in Gutenberg&#8217;s GitHub repo, clarifying misconceptions about the financial stability of the project.</p>\n<p>You has been careful to disclose his bias when participating in conversations about which framework WordPress should adopt. During my interview with him, he offered the community three reasons why he sees Vue as a good fit for the project:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now that WP has decided to pick a different framework, as the creator of Vue, I surely hope that the WordPress team can adopt Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Below is why I believe Vue would be a good fit for the choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;As an independent open source project (not born from within a major corporate), Vue provides a good alignment in terms of OSS values with the WordPress project. It&#8217;s fully MIT licensed, and its development is sustained by open financial contribution channels (via Patreon and OpenCollective). This means WordPress can easily ensure Vue&#8217;s sustainability by becoming a major sponsor.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Vue is one of the most approachable frameworks out there, with an established and active community, and ever-growing amount of learning resources. Adopting Vue would provide a low entry barrier and smooth learning curve for devs just getting into WordPress development. This also aligns with what made WordPress successful.</li>\n<li>&#8220;As an incrementally adoptable framework, Vue&#8217;s flexibility means it can be adapted in different use cases ranging from embedded widgets, plugin development to full single-page applications. It can be used without any compilation step in simple use cases, while being mature and powerful enough for more complex use cases such as Calypso and Gutenberg. It offers the complete stack from vdom + ability to use raw render functions, server-side rendering, routing, state management, build tooling, browser devtool extensions, to editor tooling support.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evan You and six others from the Vue.js core team will be participating in an <a href="https://hashnode.com/ama/with-vuejs-team-cj7itlrki03ae62wuv2r2005s" target="_blank">AMA on Hashnode at 12PM on September 20</a>, inviting general questions about the project, how to use it and contribute, and general programming advice. The questions are already rolling in and their answers should provide more information about the future of Vue and its place in the wider JavaScript ecosystem.</p>\n<p>WP Tavern has also reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit" target="_blank">Jason Miller</a>, creator of Preact.js to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress selecting Preact and what it would mean for both projects. The React-alternative is another strong contender among JS libraries WordPress is looking at for use in core.</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team has been working to ensure that WordPress developers will be able to create &#8220;Gutenblocks&#8221; using any JS library they prefer with different explorations of <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463" target="_blank">framework-agnostic block rendering</a>. Ultimately, this would make creating plugins and themes less dependent on the library that is chosen for use in core. Other community members involved in the discussion, however, are keen to emphasize that the framework selected will have an impact on the greater WordPress product ecosystem, far beyond its use in Gutenberg, and are not eager to down play it as a simple technical decision. We&#8217;ll have a more detailed look on that in a separate post.</p>\n<p>In addition to the discussions on independent blogs, the Gutenberg GitHub issues queue and the #core-js channel on WordPress Slack are both hosting active conversations on the upcoming decision. This week&#8217;s core JavaScript chat has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/09/18/javascript-chat-canceled-for-september-19/" target="_blank">cancelled</a> due to many of those involved traveling or unable to attend. The agenda for the next meeting is to discuss the role a JavaScript framework will play in current and future core focuses (including but not limited to the Gutenberg editor).

HeroPress started out to be a voice for people on the fringe of WordPress, and being outside the ability to go to WordCamp practically defines the fringe.</p>\n<p>I never could figure out the logistics of how to make it work. How is money handled? International law? So the idea languished.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the world, <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/getting-a-life/">Ines van Essen</a> had the same idea. She&#8217;s far more clever than I though, and she&#8217;s making it happen. She&#8217;s starting a new organization called DonateWC, specifically to help people get to WordCamp.  Not just local WordCamps, but the large ones like WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US. Trips that can cost multiple months, or even a years salary.</p>\n<p>I am so so so excited that this is happening, Ines is my hero.</p>\n<h2>How You Can Help</h2>\n<p>To get things really rolling Ines needs some funds.  I mentioned logistics earlier; if this isn&#8217;t handled properly a tax agent somewhere is going to come investigating. A non-profit org needs to be created, a logo needs to be created, a site needs to be built, a board needs to be formed, etc. Getting started costs money.</p>\n<p>So <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/startup-cost-for-donatewc">there&#8217;s a GoFundMe page for DonateWC</a>. All things considered she&#8217;s not looking for very much money right now, we can DO THIS.</p>\n<p>If we can make this thing work it&#8217;s going to really change lives. Please help out if you can, and keep an eye on the project. The first person to get sent to WordCamp is going to make history.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=DonateWC%3A%20Getting%20People%20to%20WordCamp&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F&title=DonateWC%3A+Getting+People+to+WordCamp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23950564_1505660479.8301-150x150.png&description=DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/" title="DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/">DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 20:42:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"WPTavern: Vue Project Launches Community Campaign on OpenCollective";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74756";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"https://wptavern.com/vue-project-launches-community-campaign-on-opencollective";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4392:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-15-at-2.13.34-PM-e1505502876371.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With the recent news that <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library" target="_blank">WordPress is abandoning React</a> due to its BSD + Patents license, core contributors are now revisiting the discussion of the merits of other frameworks. Gutenberg development is currently on hold until a new library is chosen to replace React, and selection is likely to be imminent to prevent further delay.</p>\n<p><a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> is once again a strong contender with a recent surge in enthusiastic support in <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733" target="_blank">discussions on GitHub</a>, Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624213760974165/" target="_blank">social</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624383604290514/" target="_blank">media</a> posts. One of the chief concerns WordPress core contributors had regarding Vue in previous discussions was the longevity of the project and its dependence on creator <a href="https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion" target="_blank">Evan You</a>, who has historically done most of the development.</p>\n<p>The Vue project has recently been taking steps to mitigate this drawback. Earlier this week You announced that <a href="https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-is-now-on-opencollective-1ef89ca1334b" target="_blank">Vue is now accepting financial support on OpenCollective</a>, a platform for funding open source projects in a transparent way. You already has a successful <a href="https://www.patreon.com/evanyou" target="_blank">Patreon campaign</a> where contributors are paying $8,815 per month to support his work on Vue, but the new <a href="https://opencollective.com/vuejs" target="_blank">OpenCollective account</a> will support the work of core contributors and community events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I started the Patreon campaign, the primary goal was providing myself with enough income so that I can work on Vue full-time,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Today, as the Vue community grows, there are more and more contributions from the community, and OpenCollective’s transparent expense model could help us scale the financial contributions beyond a single developer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just four days after launching, Vue already has an estimated annual budget of $9,895 on its OpenCollective account. You is still independently accepting contributions on Patreon to fund his full-time work on the project.</p>\n<p><a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank">Preact</a>, the other leading contender WordPress core contributors are considering, has had an <a href="https://opencollective.com/preact" target="_blank">account on OpenCollective</a> since late 2016. Backers and sponsors have contributed to a $16,091 estimated annual budget for the project.</p>\n<p>Both Vue and Preact have growing networks of financial supporters and are not heavily influenced by a single corporation&#8217;s interests. WordPress core contributors continue to discuss the merits and drawbacks of the two frameworks on various places around the web, but the discussion is somewhat scattered and it&#8217;s difficult for participants to know where their feedback will receive consideration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main options are actually all pretty good, and we&#8217;d probably be fine going with any of them, which is makes it a tough decision — objectively and technically there isn&#8217;t one clear without-a-doubt winner,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg said today in WordPress&#8217; #core-js Slack channel.</p>\n<p>An updated post detailing the frameworks and technical considerations that contributors are now examining has yet to be published to the make/wordpress.org development blog. Having communication throughout the process of selecting the framework, instead of announcing it after the decision, would go a long way towards keeping the community informed and involved. We&#8217;ll be following the public discussion as it develops.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 19:54:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"WPTavern: WordPress Abandons React due to Patents Clause, Gutenberg to be Rewritten with a Different Library";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74834";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:118:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7411:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wrinkled-paper.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/6XVYR9HYNT">	Lalesh Aldarwish</a>\n<p>This evening Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/" target="_blank">announced</a> on his blog that WordPress has decided to move away from React due to its BSD + Patents clause licensing. Gutenberg engineers will be rewriting the new editor to use another JavaScript framework and Automattic plans to rewrite Calypso as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#8217;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#8217;t be published, and instead I&#8217;m here to say that the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg clarified that Automattic has been happy with React and that the company&#8217;s general counsel <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367" target="_blank">didn&#8217;t think they would ever run into the patent issue</a>. He also commended Facebook on being &#8220;one of the better open source contributors out there&#8221; and for making their intentions clear. Ultimately, Mullenweg decided that he wasn&#8217;t comfortable with the larger WordPress community inheriting the patents clause:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the long-term consistency with core is worth more than a short-term hit to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses, many open source project leaders and developers <a href="https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies" target="_blank">petitioned Facebook to consider re-licensing React</a>, as many React-based projects are now having to be rewritten. <a href="https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license" target="_blank">Facebook decided it wasn&#8217;t budging on the patents clause</a> and opted to continue protecting its own interests, fully recognizing that it may lose some React community members.</p>\n<p>In the past Mullenweg has been outspoken about how Automattic was betting on React. Many in the community considered WordPress adopting React to be a foregone conclusion, given that both Calypso and Jetpack&#8217;s new admin interface were built on it, as well as WordPress&#8217; new Gutenberg editor. In making the costly decision to rewrite Gutenberg and Automattic&#8217;s products in another library, Mullenweg has demonstrated he is willing to lead the WordPress project in a direction where the community can feel confident about continuing to use and extend the software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#8217;re always listening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg could certainly use the extra time and may gain a new crop of contributors, given that the learning curve for the new library isn&#8217;t likely to be as steep as learning React.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, WordPress core contributors had <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-debate-heats-up-contributors-narrow-discussion-to-react-vs-vue" target="_blank">narrowed their considerations for a new JavaScript framework to React and Vue</a>. It appears that <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> is still a strong contender. After a commenter on Mullenweg&#8217;s post suggested switching to Vue, he replied that it has been frequently suggested and that the team has met with Evan You, Vue&#8217;s lead developer.</p>\n<p>When I <a href="https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion" target="_blank">interviewed Evan You in June</a>, he said he didn&#8217;t have enough perspective on WordPress core to make an unbiased recommendation but offered feedback on some technical issues being discussed at the time. He also clarified some common misconceptions about Vue, which WordPress&#8217; React proponents had been using as leverage in their arguments against adopting it.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg also confirmed in the comments of his post that <a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank">Preact</a> is another library under consideration. Preact.js is a lightweight 3kB alternative to React that uses the same API but is MIT-licensed. Some are already speculating about Preact being the front-runner for the replacement, as Gutenberg already has a branch devoted to trying it.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a Preact “try” Gutenberg branch. But there is no Vue.js “try” Gutenberg branch. <a href="https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b">https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" /> (@carlhancock) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/908510738066657281">September 15, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, Mullenweg&#8217;s comment that the decision &#8220;will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year,&#8221; seems to only be feasible if the team rewrites the project using Preact.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For Gutenberg, not Calypso.

Many are thankful and relieved that Mullenweg made the tough decision to change course and select another library after investing so heavily in React.</p>\n<p>The discussion regarding the new framework continues behind closed doors and is not open to the public, although a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2732" target="_blank">pull request for using Preact in Gutenberg</a> is open on the project&#8217;s GitHub repo and some community discussion regarding the library selection is happening there.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 05:39:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: On React and WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47558";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3758:"<p>Big companies like to bury unpleasant news on Fridays: A few weeks ago, <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/">Facebook announced</a> they have decided to dig in on their patent clause addition to the React license, even after Apache had said <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303">it’s no longer allowed for Apache.org projects</a>. In their words, removing the patent clause would "increase the amount of time and money we have to spend fighting meritless lawsuits."</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m not judging Facebook or saying they&#x27;re wrong, it&#x27;s not my place. They have decided it&#x27;s right for them — it&#x27;s their work and they can decide to license it however they wish. I appreciate that they&#x27;ve made their intentions going forward clear.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Automattic used React as the basis for the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">ground-up rewrite of WordPress.com we called Calypso</a>, I believe it&#x27;s one of the larger React-based open source projects. As our general counsel wrote, <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367">we made the decision that we&#x27;d never run into the patent issue</a>. That is still true today as it was then, and overall, we’ve been really happy with React. More recently, the WordPress community started to use React for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/17/dev-chat-summary-february-15th-4-7-3-week-3/">Gutenberg</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">the largest core project we&#x27;ve taken on in many years</a>. People&#x27;s experience with React and the size of the React community &#8212;  including Calypso &#8212; was a factor in trying out React for Gutenberg, and that made React the new de facto standard for WordPress and the tens of thousands of plugins written for WordPress.</p>\n<p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#x27;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same.

Both camps <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-meetup-groups-in-belfast-and-dublin-are-planning-wordcamps-for-2016-and-2017" target="_blank">began the early stages of planning last year</a> and the two communities have shared some of the same organizers across their teams to help get these new camps off the ground in Ireland.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will be held at <a href="http://business.dcu.ie/" target="_blank">DCU Business School</a> and ticket sales will be capped at 250. In truly affordable WordCamp tradition, tickets are only €35 and include access to two tracks of speakers on both camp days, catered lunch, and an after party on Saturday night in Dublin City Centre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given it’s our first WordCamp Dublin it’s difficult to select a venue when we’ve no idea about how many people would like to attend,&#8221; co-organizer Colm Troy said. &#8220;But demand so far has been great so if you want a ticket I’d recommend getting one sooner rather than later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the camp&#8217;s five organizers are also part of the Dublin WordPress meetup, which is fairly active with 25-30 people attending regularly. They meet the first Thursday of every month and host a local speaker to teach attendees something new. WordPress developers generally gravitate towards the more technical talks, while WordPress users are more interested in talks about improving and promoting their websites.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will feature one track with advanced WordPress, coding, and development topics and a second track that covers aspects of running a business, growing website traffic, podcasting, and other related topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;​The Dublin WordPress community, based on what I’ve seen and experienced elsewhere (Buenos Aires, Paris, Vienna, UK, Italy), is pretty unusual,&#8221; co-organizer Rodolfo Melogli said. In addition to co-organizing the local WordPress meetup, Melogli also organizes the Dublin E-commerce and WooCommerce Meetups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have complete beginners, who after years of using other CMSs have finally decided to start using WordPress,&#8221; Melogli said. &#8220;We have passionate bloggers, who have been exploiting the SEO and content management features of WordPress since the very beginning. Then, we&#8217;ve got successful themers, popular plugin developers and experienced WordPress freelancers. Making sure everyone is catered for at each WordPress meetup and at the upcoming WordCamp is our biggest challenge and main priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The beautiful thing about the WordPress community, and especially in Dublin, is that you can have a successful theme seller sitting beside a complete beginner. And they both have things to share.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers have just announced the <a href="https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/speakers-2017/" target="_blank">full lineup of speakers</a> for the WordCamp and co-organizer Colm Troy said the team was &#8220;blown away by the quality and quantity of excellent speaking applications&#8221; they received.</p>\n<p>The camp&#8217;s designers have created a new &#8220;blocky&#8221; style wapuu for the occasion to accompany the event&#8217;s modular design theme. They were aiming for a Lego-like wapuu while incorporating the cosmopolitan landmark &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_of_Dublin" target="_blank">Spire of Dublin</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-dublin-2017.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;​We have a couple of ideas floating around that will definitely add a unique Irish aspect to WordCamp Dublin but it’s too early to let the cat out of the bag on those yet,&#8221; Troy said. &#8220;In terms of what people can expect, Dublin and Ireland in general has a well earned reputation as one of the most welcoming places in the world. In many ways, our welcoming spirit is closely aligned with the ethos of the WordPress community and I think it’s going to be a really special weekend for attendees regardless of whether they’re new to WordPress or WordCamp veterans.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:15:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: GitHub Partners with Facebook to Release Atom-IDE";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74752";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wptavern.com/github-partners-with-facebook-to-release-atom-ide";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3269:"<p>GitHub <a href="http://blog.atom.io/2017/09/12/announcing-atom-ide.html" target="_blank">announced</a> the launch of Atom-IDE this week, a new set of packages that extend its open source JavaScript-powered code editor to include IDE-like functionality.

Users who want to get started with Atom-IDE will need to install the Atom IDE UI package as well as an IDE language support package (i.e. <a href="https://atom.io/packages/ide-php" target="_blank">ide-php</a>).</p>\n<p>Using Atom-IDE currently requires Atom Beta 1.21+. In the future the team plans to add support for more languages, which will most likely happen through outside package contributions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the help of our community, we plan to expand the number of languages that Atom-IDE can support and make it possible for you to run and edit applications, making Atom-IDE a true IDE,&#8221; Damien Guard said. &#8220;We hope to see future language support for the great languages out there including Rust, Go, Python, etc.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 02:12:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Display Widgets Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Malicious Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74768";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6033:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-widgets/" target="_blank">Display Widgets</a>, a plugin with more than 200,000 active installs, has been removed from WordPress.org due to its authors inserting malicious code. SEO consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-law-9444b637/" target="_blank">David Law</a> was the first to bring this issue to the attention of the plugin team after discovering that Display Widgets was inserting content into sites from external servers and also collecting visitor data without permission.

According to their independent investigation, the plugin included a backdoor that allowed the plugin author to publish spam content to the sites where Display Widgets is installed. It also prevented logged-in users from being able to see the content.</p>\n<p><a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2017/09/malicious-code-display-widgets/" target="_blank">Pagely banned the Display Widgets plugin</a> from its hosting platform this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For our customer’s safety, we have banned the plugin from our customer sites&#8230;The plugin will remained banned on our network until a time that we see someone has taken responsibility for the plugin and the future of patching its code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets had recently changed hands, as it was acquired from the team that created Formidable Forms.

They do not receive a notice in the WordPress admin about the plugin having been removed from the directory. Since Display Widgets was a fairly popular plugin, there are likely many sites that still have it active and those website owners are probably unaware of the spam content they are publishing.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the plugin team issued a notice that <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-2-7-is-safe/" target="_blank">Display Widgets 2.7 is a clean version</a> that restores the plugin to version 2.0.5 before the malicious code was added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will be leaving this version deploying updates, however at this time we will NOT be allowing for its adoption. The second owner has effectively destroyed any trust a person might have in the plugin.</p>\n<p>Note: You CANNOT visit the page or download it as a new plugin for a reason. This plugin is done. It’s not supported, it’s not worked on, nothing. So if you have it, upgrade. Otherwise, find something else to use.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets is now likely to end up in the graveyard of abandoned plugins, but there are many other options for adding conditional widget display to WordPress sites. Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/widget-visibility/" target="_blank">widget visibility module</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-options/" target="_blank">Widget Options</a> by Phpbits Creative Studio, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-sidebars/" target="_blank">Custom Sidebars</a> by WPMU Dev, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-aware-sidebars/" target="_blank">Content Aware Sidebars</a> are a few popular alternatives on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The plugin team does not currently disclose why certain plugins have been closed or removed from WordPress.org, but they are working on providing better communication for users. One meta trac <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2627" target="_blank">ticket</a> requests that closed plugins have a public page instead of disappearing completely. In another related <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2860" target="_blank">ticket</a>, plugin team member Mika Epstein has proposed that when plugins are closed or disabled, there should be a dropdown for WordPress.org admins to select a reason why. She suggested the following as available options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Issue</li>\n<li>Author Request</li>\n<li>Guideline Violation</li>\n<li>Licensing/Trademark violations</li>\n<li>Merged into Core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue with Display Widgets was fairly public as users posted about their investigations on the WordPress.org support forums and various companies issued warnings about it. However, many plugins are disabled without the public knowing why. Even a short explanation like the proposed examples above would be a major improvement over leaving WordPress.org plugin users in the dark. It would assist site owners in knowing whether they need to prioritize looking for an alternative or simply wait until the situation is resolved.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:08:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"HeroPress: Making My Own Normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2098";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:114:"https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=making-my-own-normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8262:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine." /><p>As long as I can remember being normal was my only goal in life. If only I could be normal, then everything would be alright. There was not a lot wrong in my life when I was a kid, growing up in a small dutch town. I had a normal family with 2 parents (a mum and a dad) and a younger sister. My life was pretty normal. The problem was: It didn’t feel normal; I didn’t feel normal. You see, everybody was going through life living by certain rules and I lived my life not knowing those rules. Nobody told me, but apparently they told everybody else.</p>\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\n<p>When I was 35 I got diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. I cannot tell you how relieved I was after receiving such a clear diagnoses. All those years working so hard to fit in there was an explanation why I didn’t. Why I couldn’t. That was a big deal. It was not that I wouldn&#8217;t that I didn’t try hard enough or was to lazy. There was something different about me why I couldn’t. Not understanding the rules of life? Being clumsy and inappropriate in social situation? Being obsessed about some things and totally not interested in others? It was all part of the package.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting the right diagnosis changed everything and at the same time it didn’t change anything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problems I had to face were still the same. The way to handle them just got more clear. And there was help. I started reading books, I started therapy and I started working with a coach to find a way to integrate this new knowledge into my life. I started looking at what I needed (what??) and finding ways to take care of myself. I really thought this was it. I found the keys, I could learn the rules and finally be a normal person.</p>\n<p>And then I got fired.</p>\n<p>Having a job was a big part of being normal in my head. Getting fired ruined my chances of ever getting there. I was working as an assistant manager in the local library. I liked my job, and the people I worked with and they liked me. I loved going to work. But the library had to cut their expenses and I was one of the people that got fired. It happens but I was completely shocked.</p>\n<p>My experiences with jobs were not good (to put it mildly). There wasn’t one I kept longer than 2 years. You can do the math; I had a lot of jobs since I started working. Some were fun most were not. I got fired many of times. Getting fired was not a new thing. Liking a job and not wanting to get fired and getting fired anyway was what upset me the most. So I decided to start my own company.</p>\n<h3>Taking Control</h3>\n<p>Looking back it was a ridiculous plan but strangely enough, it worked out. I started helping people with their Social Media and building website with WordPress.</p>\n<p>I learned WordPress for fun. I wasn’t interested in computers or tech stuff. I was just a little obsessed with making a website for the domain name my boyfriend gave me for my birthday a few years earlier. I had nothing to say but was totally fascinated by what you can do with a website. It was like magic to me. Some written code turned into a beautiful page, or an ugly one. I wanted to know all about that. Building things with HTML and CSS was easy. Code is logic (and poetry of course;-)). It does what you tell it to do. If it doesn’t you did something wrong. Never a discussion about it.</p>\n<p>I shied away from people. It was too confusing for me now that I found something that was so easy and logical.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I could make money without seeing other people, it felt like heaven.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For a while. This is really what makes this whole thing so disturbing. I want to be alone, but also want to be around other people. I appear to be good with people. A lot of people like me (who knew?!). They have no idea how confusing it is not knowing what the underlying rule set is others are acting by. It’s like interacting with someone from a totally different culture speaking a different language but both of you don’t know that. I got really good at guessing things through the years, but that didn’t make it any less uncomfortable. I also got really scared. Because not all people are understanding and friendly when you try to explain.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>In 2011 I went to my first WordPress meetup. I was shocked! These people did what I did and actually knew what they were doing and talked about it. I was blown away with all this new knowledge and information. I needed to know more and learn more. So I went back into my WordPress cave and studied, practiced and learned more.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe happened for the first time in 2013 in The Netherlands. I signed up as a volunteer. I visited WordCamp NL the year before. As a visitor I didn’t know how to meet new people. That was a lonely experience. I loved the knowledge that was shared but I knew I had to find a way to talk to those people. I figured being a volunteer would give me something to do and a reason to talk to people. And it did.</p>\n<p>I met new people, I was shy, I was scared, I acted totally inappropriate and I was exhausted for a week after the event but I did it. The people were nice. Some seem to like me and I had fun. This was a totally new experience. If only this could normal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I attended more WordCamps, always as a volunteer, that was my safe place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My confidence grew. The number of people I knew grew. The amount of fun I had grew. And never ever did I feel not normal. As my confidence grew I got more visible and things got even better. It’s an upward spiral. This year I held my first talk, at WordCamp London. I was MC at WordCamp EU in Paris en I am on the organising team for WordCamp EU 2018 (BIG things!).</p>\n<p>Did these experiences end my quest to becoming “normal”?</p>\n<p>When I turned 40 I decided to quit the quest. I was done trying to be normal. Not because I became normal but I broadened my worldview. There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine. It took me a while ( and a lot of redirections) to find the one that fits me best.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Making%20My%20Own%20Normal&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F&title=Making+My+Own+Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-150x150.jpg&description=Making My Own Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/" title="Making My Own Normal"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/">Making My Own Normal</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:00:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Wendie Huis in ‘t Veld";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: WordPress.org Adds New Support Rep Role for Plugin Pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74726";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-adds-new-support-rep-role-for-plugin-pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1424:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/collaboration.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress.org introduced a new feature for plugin pages this week that highlights official support representatives. Plugin authors can now find the UI for adding support reps under the Advanced View on the plugin page.

It includes the ability to mark forum topics as resolved or sticky. Previously, only plugin authors were able to do this, which made it difficult for support teams to fully manage forum topics. Support reps will now have their interactions highlighted in the forum:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/support-rep-reply.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Adding these official indicators to support reps&#8217; replies puts them in context within the thread and lends more authority to their answers.

With billions of dollars flowing through the WordPress economy, tensions are high, as many people support themselves and their families with the revenue earned from products and services that have been built on the existing editor.</p>\n<p>First impressions range from outright rejection of the new editor to those who embrace it and are hopeful for what it will bring to WordPress. For the past several years, most major new features added to WordPress have come through the feature plugin/feature project process where release leads and other contributors decide whether a proposed feature is ready for merge. The Gutenberg project is taking a somewhat different path to core in that Matt Mullenweg has already confirmed that <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-addresses-concerns-about-gutenberg-confirms-new-editor-to-ship-with-wordpress-5-0" target="_blank">Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0</a>, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready. This approach is part of Mullenweg&#8217;s new strategy for core development that makes releases more project-based instead of time-based.</p>\n<p>One of the most common concerns that developers and agency owners have about the plan to include Gutenberg in 5.0 is that they may need to hold back some of their sites from updating. The most vocal opponents have called for a way to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of Gutenberg so that it isn&#8217;t forced on their users.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://valiantchickendigital.com/blog/wordpress-new-coke-moment/" target="_blank">WordPress is about to have its New Coke moment</a>,&#8221; Nate Hoffelder shared his first impressions of the new edidtor after taking it for a test run. He said he appreciates the changes it promises but was unable to figure out how to create the blocks in the demo and worries about the &#8220;average non-techie&#8221; trying to use the interface.</p>\n<p>Hoffelder referenced Coca-Cola&#8217;s attempt to introduce New Coke in April 1985, which quickly ended in consumers calling for a return of the original flavor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My gut feeling is that if users share my frustrations with Gutenberg, they will demand the return of the old interface,&#8221; Hoffelder said. &#8220;But the official release is months and months away, so it is entirely possible that a UX (user experience) expert will force the Gutenberg developers to make Gutenberg easier to use before it is inflicted upon an unsuspecting public.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Users Will be Able to Restore the Old Editor with a Plugin after Gutenberg Lands in Core</h3>\n<p>WordPress will move forward with the Gutenberg editor as the default experience in the 5.0 release, but Matt Mullenweg confirmed in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587616" target="_blank">comment</a> on his blog that a plugin will be available for users who want to restore the old editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg uses TinyMCE, so a better way to think of it is that Gutenberg is a new version of our approach to TinyMCE,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It will be the default experience of WP, for people that want to use something more like what’s currently there we’ll have a plugin they can use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This should bring some relief to developers who will not yet have updated their extensions to work with Gutenberg, as well as agency owners who are not ready to give their clients access to the new editor.</p>\n<p>In his post, titled <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason" target="_blank">We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason</a>, Mullenweg shared his vision for how the new editor will will re-imagine TinyMCE and the advantages it will bring for plugin editors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Plugin developers will be able to completely integrate into every part of WordPress, including posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars without having to hack TinyMCE or squeeze their entire feature behind a toolbar button. Today, every plugin that extends WordPress does it in a different way; Gutenberg’s blocks provide a single, easy-to-learn entry point for an incredible variety of extensions. Some folks have already begun to port their plugins over, and are finding that they’re easier to build and have a much improved UI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For developers who are worried about the compatibility of their metaboxes, Mullenweg said <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587620" target="_blank">a plugin will be available for providing the legacy edit page for metaboxes</a>. One commenter, whose sites are heavily dependent on Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), asked if there is going to be a version of WordPress that will get long-term support for sites that can&#8217;t be upgraded to 5.0 without breaking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There won’t be a version of WP like that, but there will definitely be a plugin that gives you the legacy / old edit page. Make sure to let ACF know that Gutenberg compatibility is a top priority,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Scott Kingsley Clark, lead developer of the Pods plugin, said this support for legacy PHP meta boxes is welcome news for the project but that Pods is also looking to get on board with Gutenberg once the project&#8217;s engineers have a solution for metaboxes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m very excited to start using the new meta boxes from Gutenberg once the API supports it and gives us more to utilize,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;As soon as that’s available, count us in for immediate adoption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite assurances that a plugin will be available to restore the old interface, some are still concerned about how Gutenberg will impact the WordPress ecosystem. The average WordPress user has never heard of Gutenberg and its inclusion in 5.0 will be a major change.</p>\n<p>In a recent article on WPShout Fred Meyer contends that <a href="https://wpshout.com/stop-presses-gutenberg-wordpress-needs-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough/" target="_blank">Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough</a> towards giving users what they really want, which he identifies as front-end editing and the ability to create layouts within post content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;It won’t make WordPress’ core content editor competitive with hosted builder solutions, or even with WordPress’ own themes and plugins (including badly built, bad-for-the-community solutions like Visual Composer.)&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meyer believes Gutenberg has the opportunity to defragment WordPress&#8217; ecosystem of page building tools, but only if it moves towards providing &#8220;a feature-rich, developer-friendly, front-end page builder and content editor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In responding to feedback from the community, Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister has said that the project is currently focusing on editing before tackling the page building experience. The team has also been <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587693" target="_blank">working with the authors of page builder plugins</a> ahead of the next focus on customization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is still a little early to say what will happen to plugins and builders,&#8221; Lister <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587692" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;Initially, Gutenberg is focusing on the editor. The next stage is for the Customization focus (the building of pages). One thing that will need to happen is a lot of testing of existing plugins with Gutenberg. That’s how we can ensure things do work and limit issues. Ultimately, more and more plugins won’t be needed – or at least not so many together to achieve simple things. This benefits users and creates a better, more unified experience for all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If users&#8217; first impression of Gutenberg is that it is unable to deliver on all of the lofty promises of the project, they may return to the old interface en masse. WordPress will then have a battle to convince users to give it a another chance as the experience improves to include customization.</p>\n<p>Multi-column layouts, which are the gateway to page building, are <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-adding-drag-and-drop-and-multi-column-support-for-blocks" target="_blank">not currently within the scope of the first official version coming to core</a>. Gutenberg&#8217;s one-dimensional, vertically stacking approach to designing pages isn&#8217;t very inspiring. This may frustrate average users whose expectations have not been tempered with the understanding that a future version will include an expanded page building experience. A plugin that allows users to opt out until it is an improvement over their current tools is going to be crucial for keeping the community happy.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 04:22:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"WPTavern: “The Final Word” Plugin Extends O2 to Pin a Highlighted Comment to the Top of a Thread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74707";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"https://wptavern.com/the-final-word-plugin-extends-o2-to-pin-a-highlighted-comment-to-the-top-of-a-thread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3311:"<p>&#8220;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-final-word/" target="_blank">The Final Word</a>&#8221; is a new plugin that extends O2 to highlight a comment at the top of a thread. <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/o2" target="_blank">O2</a> is the plugin successor to <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/p2/" target="_blank">P2</a>, Automattic&#8217;s group blogging theme that introduced quick posting from the front page with real-time comment updates.

Hugh Lashbrooke <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/08/24/o2-plugin-request-the-final-word/" target="_blank">created The Final Word for use on the WordPress Community Team blog</a> so that long discussion threads could be summed up in a single comment. He likened the new feature as something similar to the &#8220;accepted answer&#8221; function on Stack Exchange or other support forums where the best answer floats to the top. Discussions in the Community P2 often involve decision making, and the plugin is useful for highlighting the team&#8217;s conclusion on a matter.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/top-comment.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Final Word gives users who are able to edit the post the ability to mark a specific comment as the &#8220;top comment.&#8221; Other features include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The top comment is displayed at the top of the comment list with a ‘view in context’ anchor link</li>\n<li>The top comment is also highlighted in context in the thread</li>\n<li>Only one comment can be selected as the top comment</li>\n<li>The top comment flag can be removed</li>\n<li>Includes basic styling for top comments</li>\n<li>‘Top comment’ label can be translated and/or filtered</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin currently will not work without 02 enabled because of its specific way of handling comments, but Lashbrooke said it may be updated in the future to work without O2. (While O2 is not theme-dependent, the plugin is also not guaranteed to work with every theme and is recommended to be used in combination with the <a href="https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe" target="_blank">p2-breathe theme</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Final Word is now active on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/community" target="_blank">WordPress Community team&#8217;s blog</a> and is available for other teams to activate as well. With the number of O2 blogs that many contributors are subscribed to, there is a massive amount of information and discussion to keep up with. This plugin gives thread authors and team leaders the ability to summarize conversations and keep them more manageable for readers and participants.

A username is part of your online identity. It is meant to identify, not verify, who you are saying you are. Verification is the job of the password.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, people do not consider usernames to be secret, often sharing them openly. Additionally, many major online establishments — such as Google and Facebook — have done away with usernames in favor of email addresses, which are shared around constantly and freely. WordPress has also moved this way, allowing users to log in with an email address or username since version 4.5.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress Core Security Team Lead Aaron Campbell clarified this section of the handbook to confirm that the users endpoint is intended to be an open API endpoint that serves public data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It does in fact include usernames and user IDs (among other things) for users that have published posts in a post type that is set up to use the API, but all the data is considered public,&#8221; Campbell said.</p>\n<p>Campbell also said he is wary of entering personal data into the equifaxsecurity2017.com website, but not because it is using WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the fact that it runs on WordPress is a concern from a security standpoint, with the caveat that I don&#8217;t know what ELSE it&#8217;s using,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;&#8216;Equifax&#8217; is a trusted brand, but it&#8217;s not the official Equifax domain and the SSL certificate doesn&#8217;t verify ownership. So you know your data is encrypted, but not necessarily who it&#8217;s being sent to since you don&#8217;t know who owns the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Equifax simply didn&#8217;t build out the information site on its own domain. According to security investigator <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" target="_blank">Brian Krebs</a>, the company appears to have hired Edelman PR, a global PR firm, to handle its public response to the data breach, citing the username publicly displayed by WordPress&#8217; API.

In responding to the incident with a website that appears to have been hastily implemented for its own convenience and corporate interests, Equifax has missed an opportunity to reclaim any remaining consumer confidence from the public.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 20:04:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: SWFUpload Will Officially Be Removed From WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74660";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wptavern.com/swfupload-will-officially-be-removed-from-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2000:"<p>SWFUpload is an open-source library that was used by WordPress in 2011 and earlier that allowed users to upload files.

If you use one or more of the plugins mentioned above, please get in touch with the author and ask if it will function <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/09/07/removing-swfupload/">without SWFUpload in core</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 08:06:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: WordCamp Ann Arbor to Host Second WordCamp WarmUp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74654";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-ann-arbor-to-host-second-wordcamp-warmup";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2080:"<p><a href="https://2017.annarbor.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Ann Arbor, MI</a>, is set to take place October 13-14 and for the second year in a row, organizers will host a secondary event called <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-warmup-an-experimental-event-aimed-at-breaking-the-ice-for-new-wordcamp-attendees">WordCamp WarmUp</a>.

Meanwhile, discussions about Gutenberg&#8217;s timing, implications, UI, architecture, and other aspects of the project continue across the web, as the community grapples with what this new editor will mean for the future of WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/09/05/whats-new-in-gutenberg-september-5/" target="_blank">Version 1.1.0</a> was released this week with a new autocomplete-shortcut for adding new blocks without leaving the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Many testers have been frustrated with the amount of pointing and clicking required to create new blocks. Autocomplete for blocks is a new feature that partially answers this problem, but it relies on the user knowing that typing a slash <code>/</code> in a new default paragraph block will trigger autocomplete. It may also be added to other blocks in the future.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/autocomplete.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;We still need to get the point-click/tap interactions right since most people won’t discover, remember, nor use keyboard shortcuts,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Matías Ventura <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587704" target="_blank">said</a> in response to user feedback on the plugin.</p>\n<p>This release of the plugin adds the ability to remove images from the gallery block inline. It works smoothly and resizes the thumbnail previews to fit the available space after an image is removed.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gutenberg-gallery-delete-image.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 1.1.0 also includes small updates like the ability to set links to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2628" target="_blank">open in a new window</a>, accessibility improvements to the add-new-category form, caption styling for video blocks, adjustments to column width calculation in the gallery block, and many other tweaks and improvements. The <a href="http://gutenberg-devdoc.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Gutenberg docs</a> also received <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2638" target="_blank">an updated design</a> and improvements to the content.</p>\n<h3>A Preview of How Gutenberg Will Interact with Themes to Build Websites</h3>\n<p>Gutenberg engineers elaborated on how they expect the new editor will work with themes in a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/31/gutenberg-themes/" target="_blank">post</a> on the make.wordpress./core blog. Matías Ventura published two video examples to demonstrate where they see Gutenberg headed on its journey towards becoming a full-fledged website building tool. Ventura said this is the long-term goal after the project completes the post and page editing milestone.</p>\n<p>The first video shows how Gutenberg can be used for page building, starting with a blank slate and a theme that defines specific styles for blocks. The second one shows how a theme might include templates with blocks already in place that provide users with a guided page-building experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These examples clarify some of the benefits the team is aiming for with Gutenberg and how WordPress theme authors will be able to build more user-friendly experiences on top of the new editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are quickly put together, but I hope it shows how things can progress even with very straightforward theme integration,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;As soon as we expand the scope and include more blocks (site title, site header, menus, more widgets, etc), and describe a way to store page templates as a «list of blocks», Gutenberg would be fundamentally capable of building an entire website.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 07 Sep 2017 20:02:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 287 – WordPress Meetups, Events, and WordCamps with Andrea Middleton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=74614&preview=true&preview_id=74614";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-287-wordpress-meetups-events-and-wordcamps-with-andrea-middleton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1776:"<p>In this episode, <a href="https://jjj.blog/">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href="https://andreamiddleton.blog/">Andrea Middleton</a>, Dot org Wrangler at Automattic.

People would know all the neighbors, they would pay each other visits every week to talk about what’s been going on in the community and to have a beer or two. It all seemed great until the moment when I got a bit older and went to Junior High School. My hair, unlike all other boys’, was long and I enjoyed listening to rock / metal music, the genre that was considered weird, unknown, maybe even evil.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Suddenly this friendly community started treating me like an alien, someone they refused to treat as one of their own or spend time with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Almost every day I would get some beatings from school bullies, they would pull my hair, call me names, in short &#8211; my life became miserable. I had to find a way to survive, something to focus on.</p>\n<p>That’s when I started spending even more time with my computer, playing Diablo (I even set up a Diablo fan club which became quite popular in Poland) and other multiplayer games that connected me with new people. All these interesting personalities living there, somewhere far away, (and the unforgettable sound of a dial-up modem) made me believe there was something good out there waiting for me.</p>\n<p>Next, natural step was the analysis of how a game could be created. I spent months looking at the code and analyzing its components. There weren’t many tutorials back then, so sometimes it took a while to figure things out. But it all led to building my first website, which was full of tables and hundreds of colorful elements, everything was there! I was so proud of myself! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<p>When I went to High School, I already knew a thing or two about coding and I wasn’t afraid to use it! I moved to a big city, got my first job as a graphic designer and started renting my own apartment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was very young, full of energy and determination to change my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After a while I got another job and another, and suddenly I realized that coding became an essential part of my life. Instead of learning chemistry and biology, I spent my nights learning new ways of improving my skills and finally was offered a pretty sweet job in a huge company, where I led a team of front-end developers. Yes, I was about 19, but I felt so mature. It’s so funny now, when I recall that feeling of accomplishing “everything”, but hey, I knew CSS ‘hacks’ on IE 6, I knew it all!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course, I had heard of WordPress, but none of the ‘true’ coders would use it, so why would I want to dig into that?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, I’m glad someone helped me change my mind. In 2010 my colleague invited me to join him on WordCamp. In Poland WordPress was still considered a cute little tool for creating internet blogs, so I thought going there would be a waste of time, but it turned out to be a life-changing experience. The opportunity to meet people from different countries, hear them talk about the growing possibilities of WordPress made me realize I was in the right place. The fact that a few people I met there are still my friends today only stresses the importance of that event.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It simply dawned on me that it’s not really about the CMS or other technical elements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress turned out to be a tool that led me to meeting a fantastic community of interesting and friendly people. And this was one of the reasons I wanted to delve further into WordPress.</p>\n<p>Two years later I started cooperating with a company based in the United States. Their main tool to build sites on was WordPress, obviously. By the way, I’ve been with this company for over 5 years now and to be honest, I can’t imagine my life without those guys now, but I don’t want to keep you here too long, so let’s move on. I quit my safe, ‘nine to five’ job to the dismay of my parents and started working remotely. Everything was so new, so exciting, but at the same time physically and mentally exhausting. I was doing my master’s degree in e-business and I rarely slept through the night, mostly because my clients were from different time zones.</p>\n<p>To make things more exciting, I applied for a grant from the European Union and registered my own little company in Poland. But hey, I still felt unsated. It took me around a year to decide to move my company to the United States and go there to manage it. Actually, part of this time was spent on convincing my wife to quit the job she didn’t like anyway, but again, no subplots.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To say that moving to the States was easy would be a monstrous lie.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dealing with visas and all types of immigration documents is very time-consuming and caused us way too many sleepless nights, but eventually we got to California! I registered my company (again!), opened a bank account (you wouldn’t believe how difficult it was, so thank you, dear Russian lady for fighting with the system for over 2 hours!), and looked for a place to stay.</p>\n<p>Almost 3 years have passed, I’ve been given a chance to work with amazing people whom I truly admire, and I work for and with a few startups that, I admit, are close to my heart. One of the projects my wife and I are working on is a platform (based on WordPress, of course) that will help freelancers find good, well paid projects. Again, right time, right place, no doubt about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I know you&#8217;ve heard it a thousand times before. But it&#8217;s true &#8211; hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don&#8217;t love something, then don&#8217;t do it.“ (Ray Bradbury)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very often people ask me if it’s all worth it, if I’m a masochist and enjoy burning the midnight oil, but I don’t see it that way. If I have a goal, whether it’s one to create a new website, or learn how to prepare real pierogi (dumplings) for my wife, I’m ready to spend as much time as needed to accomplish it. Sure, if it’s not something I truly ‘feel’, I might not be able to devote 100 percent of my energy to make it happen, but I like to think it’s a matter of making the right choices.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying it’s all rainbows and butterflies right now, I’m not a guy who spends his days surfing or drinking cocktails. To be honest I don’t think I’ll ever be that guy. I’m still working very hard and I rarely take days off, but at least when I go to bed I have a feeling that I’ve done all I could to help others and improve my skills as a front-ender, project manager and most of all, a human being.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Crafting%20the%20Life%20You%20Want&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F&title=Crafting+the+Life+You+Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/090617-150x150.jpg&description=Crafting the Life You Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/" title="Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/">Crafting the Life You Want</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 12:00:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Damian Samolej";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: Jetpack 5.3 Adds PHP 7.1 Compatibility, Better Control for WordAds Placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74547";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-3-adds-php-7-1-compatibility-better-control-for-wordads-placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2636:"<p><a href="https://jetpack.com/2017/09/05/jetpack-5-3-php-7-1-compatibility/" target="_blank">Jetpack 5.3</a> was released with compatibility for PHP 7.1, a task the Jetpack team has been working on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6106" target="_blank">since January 2017</a> after they received multiple reports of <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6629" target="_blank">failures with PHP 7.1 when opcache was enabled</a>. This interfered with XML-RPC requests and some users reported issues managing their sites from WordPress.com and connecting to third-party apps. Downgrading to PHP 7.0 or disabling opcache in PHP 7.1 provided temporary workarounds for many users but this is no longer required as of Jetpack 5.3.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, <a href="https://wptavern.com/jetpack-4-5-expands-monetization-with-wordads-integration" target="_blank">Jetpack added integration with WordAds</a>, WordPress.com’s advertising program. Over the past few years the program has evolved to get better at distinguishing sites with higher quality traffic and allocating earnings accordingly. This correction, along with industry-wide declining ad rates, has given publishers more modest earnings expectations after the first few years of unpredictable payouts. Jetpack 5.3 offers customers on the Premium and Professional plans more control over how ads are displayed.</p>\n<p>This release adds the ability for publishers to display multiple ads and introduces more control options for where they can be placed. Since WordAds pays based on the number of impressions (combined with many other factors) and not the number of clicks, selecting the right combination of placement options is important for success.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordads-jetpack5-3.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other notable changes and improvements include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can preview their sites without leaving WordPress.com</li>\n<li>WordPress.com Toolbar updated to include link to comments</li>\n<li>Omnisearch feature was removed</li>\n<li>Improved performance in the admin by cutting back on unnecessary requests</li>\n<li>VideoPress shortcode includes option to stop video from looping during autoplay</li>\n<li>Fixed compatibility issues with plugins using TinyMCE</li>\n<li>Re-added a filter for Widget Visibility that was accidentally removed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a full list of all the changes included in Jetpack 5.3, check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/#developers" target="_blank">changelog</a> on WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 05:46:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids Attendees Share First Impressions of Gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74538";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-attendees-share-first-impressions-of-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2688:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-grand-rapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>While attending <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> I had the opportunity to interview developers and business owners about their first impressions of the new Gutenberg editor. Many attendees I spoke to had not yet heard of the project but were intrigued and decided to install the plugin on a test site. A few attendees were developers who have already contributed to Gutenberg and are experimenting with extending the editor.</p>\n<p>Those who have tested the beta have varied concerns, depending on how they use WordPress in their professions. Some are waiting to begin testing until the plugin provides a more consistent experience. One of the most common concerns for developers is how the editor will handle meta boxes. Freelancers and agency owners are waiting to see how the new editor will affect their businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How much am I going to have to change what my company does as a business to build websites with this new tool?&#8221; Topher DeRosia asked.</p>\n<p>Agency owner Sara Dunn said she is excited about what Gutenberg will bring to WordPress and undaunted by the prospect of getting clients acquainted to a new interface. She believes the project has a lot of potential to solve some of the most common client frustrations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited about it, because I have a lot of clients who say they can&#8217;t stand WordPress because when they look at the backend and update their pages and posts, it doesn&#8217;t look how it looks on the frontend,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I really think WordPress needs this move to compete in the future, and I&#8217;m excited about where it&#8217;s going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John James Jacoby, one of the developers who has contributed to Gutenberg and experimented with extending it, said he considers it to be a very ambitious project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is probably one of the most important projects that anyone has worked on with WordPress in a number of years, in my opinion,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;My take on it is that everyone has the responsibility to try to influence the direction that it&#8217;s going to take. If we care about the open web and the freedom of how people publish to it, then we should all try to join in and help with its ongoing development and make it as good as it can be if it&#8217;s going to end up as part of WordPress in the coming months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the interviews below to see how attendees weighed in on Gutenberg.</p>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 05 Sep 2017 23:31:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: August 2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/the-month-in-wordpress-august-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6420:"<p>While there haven’t been any major events or big new developments in the WordPress world this past month, a lot of work has gone into developing a sustainable future for the project.

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href="http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href="https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span>If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i><span>submit it here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 01 Sep 2017 10:02:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids 2017 Sells Out, Organizers On Board for 2018 Event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74039";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8631:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordcamp-grandrapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The 4th edition of <a href="http://2017.grandrapids.wordcamp.org" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> was held last weekend at Grand Valley State University’s downtown Pew Campus. After a brief hiatus following previous events in 2012, 2013, and 2014, the WordCamp is back in action with first-time lead organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/mysweetcate" target="_blank">Cate DeRosia</a> at the helm.</p>\n<p>Tickets sold out shortly before the event and the vast majority of them were local to Michigan. DeRosia estimates that 40% came from Grand Rapids and 60% of attendees were within an hour radius. She published the camp&#8217;s details with a local events webpage and set up a Facebook page to increase local awareness. Organizers also received contacts from the WordPress dashboard events widget and the local MeetUp announcement.</p>\n<p>Despite being a relatively small WordCamp with 144 attendees, organizers had enough speaker submissions to fill three tracks with topics ranging from development and design to freelance best practices and scaling a business. Attendees characterized the organizers as &#8220;connectors&#8221; who have a natural gift for helping people and businesses get to know each other. DeRosia said one of the unique things about the lower Michigan WordPress community is its dedication to helping each other succeed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The core group in Grand Rapids, and really across the lower half of Michigan, is highly experienced and sincerely dedicated to helping people,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;No one is fighting to be top dog on the pile. No one&#8217;s gloating. Meetups and WordCamps are ways to give back, to encourage and grow others in the community. The focus is on the opportunities that WordPress can provide anyone and a willingness to share their years of hard earned experience to help others succeed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said the organizing team&#8217;s goal was to provide a little something for everyone and &#8220;an opportunity to learn what can be done and take that home to foster and grow at each individual&#8217;s own pace.&#8221; The event was marked by the friendliness and enthusiasm of the volunteers and provided several breaks and social times for attendees to exchange ideas and build relationships with others in the industry.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">4yrs ago I attended <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcgr?src=hash">#wcgr</a> and knew no one.

DeRosia&#8217;s teenage daughter Sophia, who has been volunteering at camps for years, also joined by contributing the event&#8217;s wapuu design and helping with operations. In the short interview below she describes how she came up with the idea for the wapuu and why she enjoys getting involved in WordPress events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DeRosia had just four months to get the event organized and said she relied heavily on information and resources from other WordCamp organizers in Michigan. She stayed with the same venue from previous camps, which she said met her criteria for making things convenient for attendees: lunch was easily available, parking was easy to find (and free), and it was within a reasonable walking distance of hotels and the after party. The camp had no issues getting local sponsorships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our sponsors were amazing,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;We came in late to the schedule and still had the sponsorship we needed with out any problems. It helps that as an organizing group we&#8217;ve created friendships in the community, but most of our sponsorship was local or regional which really helped cement the idea that another WordCamp in the area has value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said with the number of people who left talking about the next event, she anticipates there will be another WordCamp Grand Rapids in 2018 and she hopes to help again as lead organizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew tackling the &#8216;unknowns&#8217; of this first one (and doing it in a short time frame) was going to be emotionally difficult for me personally, but I also realized that most of what I was planning for this year would simply be able to move over into next year,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;In a sense, I was planning much of the next camp while planning the first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a first-time organizer, DeRosia said she was impressed by the volunteers, speakers, and attendees&#8217; positive attitudes and their willingness to help given the short time frame.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aside from being terrified of what I didn&#8217;t know, it was actually a very positive experience,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;I had tons of encouragement from our organizing team and the community at large. I was really able to build on the success of the first three Grand Rapids WordCamps, WordCamp Ann Arbor, and the newest area WordCamp in Jackson (MI). I had serious doubts that the community would even care about having another WordCamp (Was I just wasting my time?), but they proved that it&#8217;s a wanted commodity.&#8221;</p>\n\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155129"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155129.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-sara"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-sara.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-br"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-br.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-jjj"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-jjj.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers2"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers2.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154730"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154730.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154854"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154854.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155040"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155040.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 21:08:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 1.0.0 Introduces Drag and Drop for Adding Image Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74447";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-0-0-introduces-drag-and-drop-for-adding-image-blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3151:"<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/" target="_blank">Gutenberg 1.0.0</a> was released this week as another iteration in the beta period that will continue on with 1.1 next week. Design lead Tammie Lister said the team decided &#8220;not let numbers set expectations&#8221; and will carry on at the same pace with weekly releases.</p>\n<p>One of the most visible UI updates in version 1.0 is the new ability to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2447" target="_blank">add image blocks by dragging and dropping them into the editor</a>. They can be placed directly within the content (between blocks) and also onto the image block placeholder. Gutenberg includes a blue line indicator for dropzones where users can place an image.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gutenberg-image-upload.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After testing I found this feature works smoothly but is a little slow. The slight delay of uploading the image after placing it may leave the user confused about what is happening. However, feedback on this particular pull request indicates that the team is working on displaying an immediate reaction to the image having been dropped, instead of waiting for the upload to finish.</p>\n<p>This release also <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2452" target="_blank">merges the paragraph and cover text blocks</a>. Contributors agreed that the two blocks could be easily combined and the colors and font size options from the previous cover block have now been added to the block settings sidebar.</p>\n<p>A few other improvements in this release include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reworked color palette picker with a “clear” and a “custom color” option</li>\n<li>Further improvements to inline pasting and fixing errant empty blocks</li>\n<li>Added thumbnail size selector to image blocks</li>\n<li>Added support for url input and align and edit buttons to audio block</li>\n<li>Restored keyboard navigation with more robust implementation, addressing previous browser issues</li>\n<li>Added align and edit buttons to video block</li>\n<li>Show “add new term” in hierarchical taxonomies (including categories)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the experience of writing within Gutenberg is improving, and the 1.0 release announcement includes an animated gif to demonstrate a user typing in the paragraph block:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/typing.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The editor is getting better at staying out of the way when a user is writing, but the slightest mouse move within the paragraph block will slide all of the block&#8217;s surrounding controls into view. This experience can be a bit jarring, but it may be inevitable unless more of the UI can be buried under the inspector. The paragraph blocks currently display the most commonly used controls for writing text content, but I could see plugins hooking into this to create different types of writing experiences that either add more controls or pare it back to something more minimalist.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:42:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"WPTavern: WordPress.org Now Allows Plugin Authors to Specify a Minimum PHP Version Requirement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74438";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-allows-plugin-authors-to-specify-a-minimum-php-version-requirement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2585:"<p>Although WordPress core currently maintains backwards compatibility with PHP 5.2.4+, plugin and theme authors are not required to do so. When developers include features that require more recent versions of PHP, it can break sites or cause otherwise unexpected behavior. As part of a larger effort to encourage users to upgrade their PHP versions, WordPress.org now allows plugin authors to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/" target="_blank">specify a minimum PHP version requirement</a> in the <code>readme.txt</code> file with a new Requires PHP header.

It also complements WordPress’ Core PHP team&#8217;s recent efforts to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-to-add-new-page-educating-users-on-benefits-of-upgrading-php" target="_blank">educate users about the benefits of upgrading PHP</a>, as the minimum supported version was released 10 years ago and hasn&#8217;t received security patches for nearly seven years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a plugin developer (who maintains my plugins in my spare time), it is becoming increasingly difficult to build new functionality that works in older versions of PHP,&#8221; Paul Gilzow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/#comment-43314" target="_blank">commented</a> on the announcement. &#8220;There are some things that simply cannot be done in the older versions, and in those cases, I have to build out functionality to check PHP versions and disable those features. That takes time and energy away from building out other new features.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress Core Committer Sergey Biryukov said the next step is exploring the possibility of <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934" target="_blank">displaying a notice to users when they cannot install a theme or plugin</a> due to their installations not meeting the required criteria. Ideally, these notices would include host-specific instructions to assist users in getting their sites upgraded to a newer PHP version. This particular move could make a significant impact on the wider WordPress community, if popular plugins start triggering notices requiring newer versions of PHP.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 18:13:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"HeroPress: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2064";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:158:"https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60068:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/083017-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: You can''t always win.

The word ‘retire’ could be little confusing. Does that mean I am going to take leave from all of my ventures permanently? Will not be involved with anything day to day basis.

And kind of taking a break to reflect more into life. I have been working tirelessly for a decade. I need some kind of breathing space, it&#8217;s not exactly what you think though. It’s kind of reboot. I will keep expanding the idea throughout the article.

As this article is entirely about me, you have to tolerate a lot more. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" /></span></p>\n<p><strong>This is going to be the biggest ever article published in HeroPress!</strong></p>\n<h2><b>So, I always wanted to do WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>No, obviously not. In my childhood I always wanted to be <strong>a scientist, a Physicist</strong> to be exact. And it&#8217;s not just like an aim-in-life, I was literally very serious. I was always into Space Science. Later it grew more into Physics. To give you an idea how serious I was, let me tell you something. While going through some old boxes, I found out some paper-cutting from back in 1993(I was in 3rd Grade back then), about coverage of different space exploration, news about Pioneer, upcoming plan on a Probe in Saturn. I literally had a file to collect those. Back in that day, that&#8217;s what you could do most, without any internet, and from a remote part of <strong>Bangladesh</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>I was not extremely good in school, it&#8217;s not like what you read in the story, never stood 2nd type(always 1st)! It&#8217;s more like I never stood 1st type! But I was good in math, I was always progressing, and the main blessing I had in my life was support of my parents, unlikely most parents in our time, they never pushed me into things, never tried to push their judgment into my life. When I advanced from one Class to another, making some progress, they were happy with it, and I always made progress. So, they were happy, I was happy being a mediocre-student. But the issue was, in my mind, I was the best. I know how childish it sounds, but I was really a child back then! I always thought that I am best if I try enough, and if I was given enough opportunity. So, Instead of trying to do best in the Class, I focused on many things, like starting a Detective Company to Secret R&amp;D Team, and none of those was a joke, we were serious. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Reading!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I always loved reading, and I was extremely lucky to have so much opportunity to read in my childhood. My house has some collection of children’s book, some cheap but interesting translation, my parents always brought me books on every possible occasion, as that&#8217;s what would make me happy. When that was not enough, I practically sneaked into most houses in the neighborhood. I was in 7th Grade at that time, and if a neighbor had an older kid they would have more books, and good part was if you show interest in reading books, and return it carefully, they would not mind to open up their bookshelf door for you, and most of them even loved me for this. Later on, I also finished up most of my relatives collection in the same town. Later on when in high-school everyone around knew I love books. Later on, this grew on my friends as well. I was lucky to have good childhood friends, who also enjoyed books as well. So, we would gift books to each others birthday, so we could read it ourselves. And few of my friend was very good students, and they always got some scholarship money, so we spend everything in our school life on books!</span></p>\n<p><b>So, what was I was reading? Everything!</b></p>\n<p><b> &#8211; Everything!</b></p>\n<p><span>Starting from Children’s story later grew into Detective Story, Science Fiction, and later into the adventure story, literature, whatever comes into my hand. One interesting thing I also did from the very early stage, keeps track on what I am reading. It probably came from my hobby of collecting Stamps. We used to make notes and categorize our collection. So, I started doing the same for Books. I made a notebook, started noting and making a list of what I am reading, later on, I started to make some remarks, note, what I liked, what not. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Writing!</b></h2>\n<p><span>In my teenage life writing took even more meaning. I was always good at expressing myself, and creative writing. But when one of our best friends left the country, and the only way to communicate was to write letters, so, we started to do that. It took different turn very soon. We were enjoying writing letters so much, few of us in the same class who we see every day also started writing letters to each other. However, it was nothing like a love letter or anything related to the affair, we were writing about anything, everything. At one point we were in a competition who could write the longest letter. In this competition, one of my friends wrote a letter to me (again from the same class, sitting almost on my next desk! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" /> ) over 50 pages, and to defeat her I wrote an over <strong>100-page long letter</strong>! </span></p>\n<p><span>*If you are wondering what I wrote in those 100 pages &#8211; I have a very large family, where my relatives of great-great-grandfather’s cousin’s and their family are still very connected and if you saw me talking with any of them you would think they are my 1st Uncle or Aunt. So, what I did is wrote about my whole family tree, describing family history and later on describing each and every member I could remember! In my house we had a very old “Family Birth Register” (জন্ম কষ্টি খাতা), dating back in the early 1900s, I even took help from it!</span></p>\n<p>Over all this had a different impact on our life. I don&#8217;t know how hard it is to believe, but I was into Bangla Literature, specially poem as well, I even had a notebook full with my own poem! One of our classmates even wrote a full-blown 150+ pages novel in that age! And I am still enjoying writing!</p>\n<p><b>Dramatic changes in my Educational life!</b></p>\n<p><span>As described earlier, </span><span>I was average in studies</span><span> but not extremely good. And I was happy about it! All my </span><span>close friends were very good students and would achieve the first or second position in class every time. Whereas, I was happy being in the 8th or 10th position. But as said in my mind I was the best!</span></p>\n<p><span>Our educational system requires you to memorize and write as it is. But I was driven into reading books, and other things (also including playing Cricket seriously). I never tried to focus on memorizing anything. And from childhood, teachers grow an impression of what to expect from a particular student. So, for an example, my social science teacher knew for years what to expect from me, and it&#8217;s very hard to get past that impression. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was advancing from Grade 8 to 9, I took part in a Scholarship exam. </span><span>We prepared for a year. Only a handful of us was participating from our school, I was among those few, but I had literally zero chance to get the scholarship. I was not very bothered about it at all. But during the exam, we had to travel to another town to the exam, and it was in the month of Ramadan, and I did not break my fast. It was hard, I had 2 exams in a single day. When I came back home one day with my father, my mom was sad seeing me so tired and drained out. But was happy that I was still fasting. Then she told me something very simply, which started a chain-reaction in my life. She told me, &#8220;You think of yourself so highly, you spend all of your time with those same kids, who are doing so good in school. But if you really think of yourself so highly, why not try to reflect that in your grade?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Maybe it&#8217;s very normal for parents to talk like that. But as my parents never compared me with anybody or always let me do in my way, I kept on thinking about this. </span><span>What clicked in my mind was that, i</span><span>f I am really good, I should be able to do good in any circumstances, if this requires me to memorize everything I could do that. If I want to be really that good, and be a good scientist, I need to learn to cope up and fight in any situation. </span></p>\n<p><b>So, I changed myself, was even memorizing books, that I absolutely did not like!</b></p>\n<p><span>In grade 9 &amp; 10, I studied very hard. I changed my lifestyle a lot. I changed the way I write in exam paper to change the impression of my teacher. Before I was always like studying in my mind, not writing what I just read, I forced myself in writing those answer I just read, it was very hard and boring at the beginning. But I had a very good private tutor, who guided me in every way. Later on my teachers in school helped in every way possible. In Bangladesh student have to take a part in a Certification Exam after 10th Grade, to advance in College, its called SSC, Secondary School Certificate Exam. I prepared for that. At the end of 10th Grade, I almost had the book fully memorized, I could write as it is, correct to each and every comma and space. I improved my english a lot. I learned some calculous which was not part of our curriculum, just to advance myself for college, and I knew if I had to do better in Physics I need to learn math and Calculous better. I did took part in more Prep test than most other students. And ultimately in the School Preparation Exam, I did extremely well to boost up my energy!</span></p>\n<p><span>Everything was perfect, we took part in the big exam!</span></p>\n<p><b>And I did not get the grade I expected!</b></p>\n<p><span>Interestingly our batch did not get good grades in SSC</span><span>, we were the first batch in a new grading system, and we did not know that even before the exam, so none got perfect grade of 5.0, I got a very average grade(not bad, but not very good either). I was extremely disappointed, broken, but later learned to cope up.</span><span> I realized a good lesson of life that </span><b>&#8211; Even though you may work hard and go to great lengths to do everything possible, still you might have to deal with failures and disappointments.</b></p>\n<p><span>Another good thing also happened in my life too. I moved from the small town I grew up, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishwardi_Upazila">Ishurdi</a></strong>, to the Capitol of the Nation, <strong>Dhaka</strong>, and was able to get a chance in the entrance exam, of all big colleges in the country where I tried. This gave me a huge boost in confidence. I selected to study in <strong>Notre Dame College</strong>, in English Medium of Science. It was another controversial decision I made, for me a kid coming from rather a small town, and from Bangla Medium it was a tough decision, but I stick to it for the future, because I still wanted to be a Physicist, wanted to study further in my life, I knew I had to be in English Medium.</span></p>\n<p><b>I had very hard time at the beginning of College!</b></p>\n<p><span>At the start it was very hard, our whole group suffered a lot to cope up with new curriculum, our first semester in College was the worst. But later we learned to cope up, we were 130 students in our Group (famous Group 8 in Notre Dame College), we all were helpful to each other, not everyone had private teacher in this point, we shared our notes, I was living first time without my parents, I was also dealing with occasional sickness due to not eating properly. So, there was a lot of struggle, but by the end of 1st year, I was dealing with everything properly. I got a good friend circle, I was not only doing well in college, I was also enjoying my freedom and mostly dealing with anything life throws at me!</span></p>\n<h2><b>My Introduction to Computer &amp; Programming!</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, I always loved programming, before entering University I already knew some basic programming, like qBasic, FORTRAN, even some level of Pascal. The kind of society I grew up, a computer was extremely rare before the year 2000. I was kind of lucky to be able to learn basic computer usage starting from the year 1998, got my first computer in 1999. It was so rare to own a computer in that time for that part of the word, that I was not only the first kid in my class to own a computer, but only a handful of people in my town knew how to use a computer. So, though I am not from a very rich or privileged family, extremely lucky that my parents understood the importance in that time. </span></p>\n<p><span>Another interesting aspect was unlike most people, I was not fully taken over by Computer Games. I am not saying gaming is bad, but most of the people I later see own a computer, the main thing they do with it was playing the game all the time. And you have to understand that almost pre-internet period in Bangladesh. I use the internet first in my life back in 2001. I was more into tweaking things, trying to create or modify the software or create very basic type tools. I am super amazed by internet from first interaction. The search engine was in its peak time, discovering new resource was easy. I tried creating my first webpage in Yahoo Geocities back in 2001, wap page generator was also taking shape in coming years. </span></p>\n<p><b>Say Hi to WordPress in my life!</b></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2068 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1-1024x863.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="809" /></a>M Asif Rahman &#8211; Wearing Tees by WordPressian Group!\n<p><span>      I created my first blog back in 2003 in Blogger, but while trying to add a sidebar and customizing home page look, I find it&#8217;s very difficult for me to do anything in ASP.net, then I found WordPress, back in the year 2004. I still remember reading Matt’s blog and write up about how the whole project is moving ahead from b2 cafelog. WordPress was so easy, I hardly knew any PHP in that time, but my HTML and CSS knowledge was well enough for me being able to edit my personal blog. At the start hosting was one issue, but again I was lucky to manage one. Later when WordPress.com came, I migrated my blog over there and was happy at the beginning, as less hassle. I was also heavily involved with forum community. There was some very large community for webmaster and developer, I loved PHPbb and other solution for forums as well. But after experiencing some massive vulnerabilities, which lead to a major data breach, I focused more on personal blogging and soon into web development. Wth WordPress it was extremely easy to create a website, plugin and theming turn out to be not a complex task. The community and developers contributing in this ecosystem were another main factors. I feel very connected with the whole ecosystem, eventually became habituated with this, and started to feel it&#8217;s my comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><b>How I started my career and company!</b></p>\n<p><span>I was using the name A. R. Communication, an as an acronym of my initials (Asif Rahman) back in 2001 as well, but it was nothing serious, no particular business. When in college, to support myself I first started a Marketing Trainee job in a Multi-international company. It was convenient with my college time and location, and they were literally paying to learn things. I started it just the as need of money, but later I enjoyed marketing, corporate training, and even enjoyed sales training as well. But I never took that job a as career choice.</span></p>\n<h3><b>My first venture!</b></h3>\n<p><span>In the year 2003, before even going to Universities I started a full 4 color magazine, printed publication with a close friend of mine. It was a fun ride. The name of the magazine was “</span><b>Fortnightly Tumi</b><span>”, the Bangla word “Tumi” means “</span><b>You</b><span>”! It was a lifestyle Magazine. My family already had a history with the printing business, so I had some experience. We did this business very thoroughly if you consider this as our first venture. We did a proper market study, interviewed potential readers, organized group discussion, and got good funding. And we also started with bang! Hired renowned journalist and writer. I was barely <strong>19 years old</strong> that time, have very experienced people in my team over 50 years old, and managing them was good lesson. All together we published 3 edition, with good marketing trick we were able to sell 10,000 copy nationwide for that last edition, we had over 20 big brands in the country advertising with us. But still, that business did not work out. We had to shut down, as our investor (my friend’s family) want us to focus on our education instead of this, and we were probably way ahead of our time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Too many choices after college!</b></p>\n<p><span>I did fairly good in college, despite being in English medium. I applied for the various scholarship in different university all around the world, and was in a process of ISSB for Airforce as GD Pilot, the whole process was lengthy, and I was only doing it for 2 reasons.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>One of my friends asked me to collect the form, as it was close from my house, and I thought why not fill up together.</span></li>\n<li><span>GD Pilots also get the chance of studying Aeronautical Engineering and even switch to Engineering in future, and they will have a chance to study higher in that subject, which could open up my door for getting into Space Science. All for free, paid by Govt.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Interestingly I get past all the test and selected finally. But they informed me, I have to stay in GD Pilot as a cadet and will be commissioned in 2 years, but have to think Pilot as a career, I was confused, I never enjoyed or felt the passion for speed before in my life. And we had few months time before joining the Force.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the meantime, I got so many opportunities in various universities. And one of my dream to study further in Physics was too close, as I got a chance in Uni Penn, and got a scholarship there as well. I had few other opportunities at Canada and Australia. I even applied for Visa for Australia as well, but later had to decide against all of those for some family and personal reason. </span></p>\n<p><span>I ultimately left Air Force as well, me &amp; my parents agree that&#8217;sts not a good career choice for me, given the option I had. I got a scholarship at North South University in Electrical &amp; Telecommunications Engineering. And as I started my company seriously at beginning of 2004, then a University that offers Open Credit, where I am able to choose my workload, it was just convenient. So, out of all promising option, I almost chose the risky one, to make my own company and study in Bangladesh, at least for the Bachelor.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The inception of ARCom:</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, ARCom is the short version of A. R. Communications. As I found making website too easy with WordPress, and a new found talent was helping me as well. </span></p>\n<p><span>Just as I never waste time on gaming, rather enjoyed my time to tweak things, creating new application. Instead of most people, when they visit a new website, they look at the shiny look, or how good or better information it provides, whenever I visit a good site, I was always thinking how they are making money, how is this built and sustained. This quest has helped me making our first successful business. It took years, it did not turn into something very big in a night. During University years I did make many different kinds of websites, in that time I started earning first from selling websites. That was during the year 2005 or 2006, it was long before Sitepoint turn into Flippa, back in the shining days of DigitalPoint! I used that money to buy more domain. I hired my university classmate to work with me. The first outsider I hired in my company was a designer, as I needed help in there. Later it kept growing over the year.</span></p>\n<h3><b>First Big Success:</b></h3>\n<p><span>Though I already enjoyed some good (if not very big) payday by selling a website, point to note here, I was selling website as a business, not like you design a site and sell, its more about creating a business, create a process and sell it for a 2X &#8211; 5X yearly profit. But my big success came after 2008. Everything was turning so well, I was done with my University. My company was already a Team of over 20 people, with an office of 2500 square feet space. We started </span><a href="https://thetechjournal.com"><b>The Tech Journal</b></a><span>, it worked so well in every aspect. As I was into writing blogs and also into the gadget. After the first iPhone release I was involved in many ways, from working with the secret group who were Jailbreaking each and every firmware, also new kind of responsive websites, I was also into News &amp; those kinds of stuff. And because of my quest to understand how a thing works, I had a good grasp already into Content Distribution. Facebook and other Social Media are playing a role in content and distribution already. It all helped.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Tech Journal became very big!</b></p>\n<p><span>Within 6 months of start, we ranked within top 20k website. I was enjoying the ride to play with monetization and taking things into next phase. At one pick point, we were ranked even within top 4000 websites in Alexa. I had a good team with me. I finished my university already, 3 of my University friend was working with me full time. We all shared same vision for The Tech Journal, and it kept on growing. Because of our experience with WordPress we kept on innovating, for us we could build anything in WordPress, I had a solid Development team as well.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Marriage &amp; Beyond!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I got married at 2009, I was 25 years old back then. I don’t know if there is any perfect age for marriage, but I felt that was the right time, I was doing good in business, was looking for more stability in emotional life as well. I suddenly found my long lost childhood friend, <strong>Bipasha</strong>, whom I did not have any communication for past 13 years, but suddenly fall in love and we decide to get married. <strong>Just like that!</strong> I will not go into details here(it&#8217;s already too big) how we studied together since 1st grade and got detached when we were in 7th Grade, but still got married 13 years later. We started a new life, life was never better!</span></p>\n<p><b>Moving Further with WordPress:</b></p>\n<p><span>Over the year WordPress kept growing so was I. I was writing, blogging, building things with WordPress. WordCamp was already something, but I was not able to attend or participate as I was still in Universities, but after finishing up, I decide to get more involved. I spoke in my first WordCamp in WordCamp Melbourne. For many years I was also very vocal about security and optimization, so I started to get so many opportunities into speaking and participating in various things. I still remember I spent one crazy summer in the US, participating 6 WordCamps, visiting 9 States and 13 cities in the process, starting from Boston and finishing at San Francisco! </span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2069" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1-1024x514.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="482" /></a>WordCamp SF 2014 &#8211; Mission Bay Conference Center\n<p><span>I was very lucky to be able to speak at last ever WordCamp San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pursuing more into Investment!</b></p>\n<p><span>It&#8217;s mainly because of <strong>The Tech Journal</strong>, I was involved in many tech conferences, and always getting the pitch from various startups. And my new grown circle of friends from WordPress and various other tech scenes, I already established a good connection in Silicon Valley. It was in the year 2009 when I made my first Angel investment, the credit must go to my friend circle, it was years before Angel List, there was offline syndicate where folks will share investment opportunity. But I really loved talking with young entrepreneur and seeing how new business works. I kept my focus in my sector, the field I understand. So, I mainly invested in tech. Out of several investments, one of my lucky ones was Facebook, I was able to invest in <strong>Facebook</strong> before their IPO, not very early, but still Pre-IPO stage, it was one of my lucky breaks. As I was already doing good in my business I tried to utilize it. I did not start investing because I had too much cash laying around, I started because I liked those opportunities, I wanted to help those ideas or startups.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Moving into the US:</b></h2>\n<p><span>I started another business in US, where my partner was from Orlando, I spent one Thanksgiving with my Wife in Orlando, really loved the place, people, and we already got a long term Visa, and had full opportunity to live anywhere we want. My company in Bangladesh was already in a stable phase, and as I was traveling heavily for years, my team was used to being managed remotely, so it was not a hard decision. But staying far from parents was hard. So, what we started maintaining both houses in Bangladesh and Florida. For years we spend some part of the year in US, rest in Bangladesh. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Child &amp; Changes in Life!</b></h3>\n<p><span>Like everybody else our life was bound to change when we had baby. In year 2014 we were getting for our first baby. We decide to stay in US, because of better medical facility and my involvement in different things. Just a month after speaking at WordCamp San Francisco in November we were blessed with <strong>Aaniyah</strong>. Actually, our life already changed when we were planning and waiting for the baby. I was feeling the work routine I have would never let me spend the time I want to have with my baby.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2070" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh-1024x691.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="648" /></a></p>\n<h2><b>Analytify &amp; A New friendship!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I became friends with </span><a href="http://www.adnan.pk/"><span>Muhammad Adnan</span></a><span> online back in 2014, he was working with his premium Plugin <a href="https://analytify.io/"><strong>Analytify</strong></a> back then. I found this as a real good project and started talking with him, giving him various advice, and we later decided to team up, and we released the first free version of Analytify WordPress plugin on 1st January 2015. It was a success, it completely revolutionizes how people use Google Analytics in WordPress. Later Adnan visited me in the US in 2015, and together we attended WordCamp Miami and had a good trip and drive to Key West! The most interesting part of the friendship lies somewhere else. I am a Bangladeshi, and Adnan is Pakistani. Both of our nation has a very bad past. Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan, back in 1971 we fought for about 9 months, and millions of people died in the process before we got Freedom and Declared Independence from Pakistan. But it creates a life long enmity between two countries. I know for an outsider it does not make sense to keep some feelings for that long, but for its very personal for us. Our country lost so much in that war, even if you speak about just my family, My Grandmother lost half of her family in that war, Bangladeshi especially have a very strong opinion about any Pakistani. But meeting Adnan, becoming friends, and working together made me realize few interesting thing, this feeling, this agony against any Pakistani was one-way. Most of the Pakistani did not have any idea what their Government or Army did, they hardly have idea about their Ancestors’ doing. They rather still consider us Brother! Some of the history he never knew, they never read in their history book. I would never know this if it&#8217;s not for </span><b>WordPress</b><span>, we would never meet, this change in understanding for both of us never happened.</span></p>\n<p><span>And we together kept on growing <strong>Analytify</strong>, as the best Google Analytics Plugin in WordPress, and planning many interesting things together.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Coming Back to Bangladesh!</b></h2>\n<p><span>While I was staying and mostly investing in the US, I started investing in some interesting Teams in Bangladesh from the year 2012. Over the year, a few failed, but some really kept on growing. In the year 2016, in Pre-Trump period we were expecting our 2nd Baby, and it was too hard for us to manage alone in the US, and we both were missing our family. I want my kids to grow up having their family close to them, the way I grew up. I want my parents to feel close to them. Occasionally when we visited Bangladesh with our first child, I was quite blown away the way they loved and took care of the baby. It all made sense if we spend some more time in Bangladesh, and have the Baby in here. And the weird things going on with the US also motivated my decision. The kind of craziness we are seeing in the US, actually did not start just by having Trump elected. It goes way back. We were living in a  very peaceful neighborhood in Florida, a small town called Orange City, near Daytona Beach! But we could still feel the change in air. Our parents have a pending Immigration Application for near a decade, they are on the que to become US citizen anyway. We first tried to have them with us, but US Embassy in Bangladesh rejected that application, for absolutely no reason. And my other venture was already growing in Bangladesh. So, all together we decide to stay in Bangladesh for awhile, we moved in mid-2016.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Welcoming Aadiyah into the Family!</b></h3>\n<p><span>We had our 2nd Baby <strong>Aadiyah</strong> in September 2016, a bit ahead of time, my wife got little too sick, but we were able to handle everything because of having family together. We moved into a large Duplex house, to have enough space for the baby. We feel we are complete as family and never been this happy before.</span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2071" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a>Complete Family!\n<h1><b>weDevs &amp; My Legacy!</b></h1>\n<p><span>I will discuss later my involvement in Bangladeshi WordPress Eco-system. But back in 2013 I first met <a href="https://tareq.co/">Tareq</a>, a very talented Bangladeshi Programmer, running a successful WordPress product company. He and his Partner <strong>Nizam</strong> built an amazing company, and they had few very interesting and super successful products for WordPress. I started helping as possible from my end, I want them to succeed and pushing them to move forward. I became an official partner and board member of <a href="https://wedevs.com"><strong>weDevs</strong></a> back in 2015. I was helping them to grow internationally and advising them as part of the board. We established a US company and kept on growing. Though I was in WordPress for very long time, my main company <strong>ARCom</strong> was never serious into WordPress Product. I released some of <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/asif2bd">our work</a> in Open Source via WordPress.org Plugin Directory, and with my growing experience with <strong>Analytify</strong> made me dig more into WordPress products.</span></p>\n<p><span>Somehow at the end of 2016, <strong>Tareq</strong> and I was looking at our numbers for <strong>weDevs</strong> in 2016, we noticed something very important. Three of us spend more time digging deep into the numbers and re-analyzed our process and priorities. Soon we all came into understanding we have to take things forward with <strong>weDevs</strong>, the growth of the industry is very important if we want to be big in future this is the right time. They proposed to me if I could take over as <strong>CEO</strong>. Nizam was running weDevs successfully as CEO for years, and I never thought seriously about running another company, and my retirement plan was already in place. But we found this could be the best thing we could do in the year 2017, where I have little over 1.5 years before my planned retirement. </span></p>\n<p><span>So, I jumped into the ship. I always dreamed to make a rocking and successful company in WordPress product space, and it was my chance. And as it&#8217;s already a running successful company, my goal here to build a legacy, instead of just making a profitable company, built a sustainable company, and proper team, a fine management, that could grow into future, that could </span><b>outgrow us</b><span>, something even bigger than us combined. </span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2073 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a>weDevs new office &#8211; Reception Area from inside &#8211; WordPress Flavoured!\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>So, I took over <strong>weDevs of CEO</strong> in January 2017, I took 2 months as the transition period and blend fully into the day to day system. We announced this officially in the month of March. Dhaka is a very jam packed city with the highest number of people living in per square miles in the world. We were already a Team of about 25 people. I still had few other business that I have to take care. So, we moved to a new large space. A total of 5000 square feet space, fully open, we built a unique office that could sustain us for next few year. I moved my house and office in the same area, called <strong>Mirpur DOHS</strong>. Me, my partners, and almost 12 of us together moved into this area together. As we now live within 2 min distance from the office, the Traffic could not bother us at all. We gave the option for our employees to move into too. We paid the moving cost, we even adjusted salary if they faced any increase of cost for housing or anything. We took time, but now our new office is complete, it&#8217;s one very interesting WordPress themed workplace.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2074" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We are growing further, our team of 25 people will soon <strong>become a team of  50+</strong>. We are working on new stunning products, we just launched a brand new super fast Form Builder plugin named <a href="https://wedevs.com/weforms/"><strong>weForms</strong></a>. It will revolutionize the way people build forms and create anything from just a simple contact form to organize a quiz. Our team built it entirely on Vue.JS, as a single page app. It&#8217;s unbelievably fast, almost nothing we have seen so far inside WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our Team internally working very hard to update our existing product and we are working on some new things that I am incredibly looking forward to. Before I join, weDevs did not have a marketing team, we ran entirely autonomous. In last 6 months, we have built a sustainable Content &amp; Marketing Team. I am working tirelessly with my CTO &amp; COO to build a new culture. We have a two-way feedback evaluation process. I created a kind of unique in its way, a grading system where the company could give feedback to an employee, on exact point, and inform directly where they need to improve. It&#8217;s a kind of algorithm I have developed over the years and really helps you to make a happy and working team. In the same way, Employee also have the opportunity to give feedback to the company directly &#8211; about what makes them happy, how a company could help him grow more, or if the company is addressing every concern properly. We do this quarterly basis, and review in each quarter, so the improvement could always be tracked, graphed and addressed properly.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Bangladeshi WordPress Community!</b></h2>\n<p><span>This is another very proud thing I would like to talk about. When I first had a very detail conversation with Matt Mullenweg, back in 2011, he was very happy that I attending so many WordCamp, and be that much involved with the community, he asked me about WP community back my country, and told me if we are able to have a good group, a nice meetup and eventually a WordCamp, he will try to attend. I found a new role for myself, over the year we grew Bangladeshi WordPress community. Locally we have very growing and engaging WordPress Group, called WordPressians, we have over 21,000 Members in Facebook. We are a team of 15 Admin/Organizer who maintains everything, and it&#8217;s an open group so always evolving. Over the year, we 15 became very close to each other, and we all consider each other as best friend. We contribute in Open Source together, we hangout together, attend various WordCamps around together now, we plan day out together as well. This is another blessing happened to our life mainly because of WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2075" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881-1024x417.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="391" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Starting from 2013 we are official meetup chapter in Dhaka. We organized over 15 meetup, where each and every meetup of our could be considered little WordCamp, with 4-6 session, and had 150-300 attendees. We organized all of our meetup in our own platform, a WordPress plugin we created, so everything happened at &#8211; WPressians.net, not at Meetup.com, we did it with direct permission from WordPress Foundation. We have made WordCamp Application starting from 2013. And I even faced Organizer interview twice in 2014.</span></p>\n<h3><b>But the sadness!</b></h3>\n<p><span>There is one thing that hurt me a lot. Though me and our organizing team worked so hard to grow Bangladeshi WordPress community, but due to some miscommunication, we still don&#8217;t have any WordCamp yet. The foundation failed to take timely measures to proceed with our WordCamp application, we faced repeated issues in getting the proper timely response from them. Out of frustration and years of waiting back in 2015, we organized a CMS Conference in Dhaka, where we had over 10 speakers, and there were over 1500 attendees. So our team has proven their position, but things took so long from the Foundation. I wrote to foundation much time, there is one on-going conversation, still, we hope for the best, this the way Foundation handled our communication, shows the lack-of-attention clearly. I am almost devastated in this and very hurt! When I first attended and spoke in WordCamp Melbourne in 2011, I was the first Bangladeshi to ever do so. I but I kept on pushing. Now there is over 10 from even just our organizing team where they attended in various <strong>WordCamps around the World</strong>. Last year we attended WordCamp Singapore with a team of 9 people from Bangladesh. We are gaining experience, we are driven, but still lacking behind because of Foundation, sadly! I attended over <strong>50 WordCamps</strong> worldwide, I helped to organize over 10 WordCamps in various cities, but could not organize a single one in my home country for 6 years, this keeps bugging me all the time!</span></p>\n<h1><b>My Future Plan!</b></h1>\n<h2><b>Plan to retire by my next Birthday!</b></h2>\n<h3><b>weDevs to keep on Growing!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I am here at weDevs to create and fine tune the process and build the vision. I already described what&#8217;s happening in there. From my start as CEO we are seeing about 15% month to month growth in revenue and about 20% in market reach, We will keep on doing so and beyond. And we will probably get more result in long term, and building team, forming up a new culture and getting result certainly take more than 6 months.</span></p>\n<p><span>So far the plan is to me stay in Day to Day involve up until June 2018. This is not an exact day plan, could change with time. But possibly by September!</span></p>\n<h2><b>ARCom being Autonomous!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am running ARCom without much of daily maintenance for awhile now. I have Team Lead, Editors, Managers in place, that&#8217;s running their wing successfully for awhile now. There are few new plans and things my Team working, but all team has a lead, which they ran with ownership, and mostly sustainable. There are some places where we need some work, I hope it will be done by that projected time.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Geeky Social, 3rdBell and my other venture!</b></h2>\n<p><b>Geeky Social</b><span> has a solid team, and they are running amazingly. I am very proud of our team. I am part of the board and now serving as Chairman, and probably will continue to do so. I hope by next 6-9 months we will be even stronger financially, our month to month growth is already steady and growing, we are clear it will grow a lot from there. One of our core success is to grow beyond a cash-hungry business, which is incredibly hard if you are involved in Digital Media, and buying. But we got past that and now everything taking shape. I am very confident in the team and looking forward.</span></p>\n<p><a href="https://3rdbell.co"><b>3rdBell</b></a><span> faced so much issues over the year, but now we have a solid platform, the founders are incredibly motivated. Me and other investors are looking forward. I am still involved as Technical Director, this role could extend for the time being when we go through some changes, but we have solid plan to move forward, and by mid-next year, it should be i a  different height.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Me &amp; WordPress &#8211; going forward! </b></h2>\n<p><span>I will have people to maintain my plugin, and provide even better support, and few of them are even joining next month, so it will be well taken care of. I will shift the community role mostly to new people and others. Next 9 months I will dedicate to have more Contributor from my community and circle. I will literally incubate contributor,  from Core contribution to Docs and Community team. I will drive more into sharing my experience and finding over the decade. Besides writing, which I think is my superpower(!), but still under used, I will drive more into Speaking. Those are my next upcoming  Session, if you are happened to any of those WordCamp, please say Hi!</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>WordCamp Colombo, Sri Lanka &#8211; 23rd September</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b><a href="https://2017.colombo.wordcamp.org/speaker/m-asif-rahman/"><span> Making Million in WordPress Plugin But Not Being Evil!</span></a></p>\n<p><span>      2)  <strong>WordCamp Ahmedabad, India &#8211; 7th October</strong></span></p>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b> <a href="https://2017.ahmedabad.wordcamp.org/"><span>You heard content is the king, but are you paying attention to Content Distribution?</span></a></p>\n<p><span>If you read so far, you should understand how relevant both topic to my life! </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>How could I financially sustain this?</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am thinking, planning and working on this retirement plan for awhile now. The main question I got asked how could I financially sustain. I don’t know what kind of impression you have got so far by reading about my life. Yes, I own several successful ventures, running a very growing and profitable business, I also invested in the 20+ venture and was extremely lucky to enjoy some exit from the investment. But not in very big scale. Some of my investment looks promising, but that does not make me very rich in cash. So this plan further is not about having tons of cash in hand laying around, it&#8217;s more about having sustainable and ongoing earning. I do certainly have some exit I am looking forward to but my plan will not depend on it. I am confident now I could easily go beyond this month-to-month type calculation! </span></p>\n<h2><b>The Hardest Part!</b></h2>\n<p><span>When you grow business for over a decade, the main challenges are people. Like some successful venture, I also have businesses that are not cash-positive but has people involved with it for years. When you run a business, you become responsible for those people, their family depends on your decision, that type of responsibilities will limit you sometimes taking logical business decision. And really relying so much into people, and the fear of let going control could be hard dilemma any Entrepreneur could feel. </span></p>\n<p><span>But over the year I learned,<strong> sometimes you have to let go to get things done for future, sometimes you have to take a leap of faith</strong>. So, I practiced that for some time now. I am positive that things will work out, and won&#8217;t break apart.</span></p>\n<h1><b>Reason: Why I am doing this?</b></h1>\n<p><span>In some ways I feel I am doing this for very long time. I have built team, product, faced hard time, and also enjoyed when things work out, I have gone through this circle so many times. There is always hard time and I have seen how it all ultimately always worked out. I kind of want to get out of this circle. Sometimes I feel tired. Though for a person like me who single handily started everything, broke so many barriers, it&#8217;s hard to get me tensed. I know how to deal with pressure, hard time, shitty situation. In some ways I am resistant to those. But when I reflect everything in my life I am very proud what I have done, what I have Achieved.</span></p>\n<p><b>Monetary wealth did not make me rich! </b><span>But the experience and relation that I cultivated did. I feel rich because of this. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was still a teenager, dreaming to be a physicist, I had a very thorough vision of my future, I wanted to finish my PhD by age 25. Later in the course of life I became Entrepreneur. Then my goal was to become a millionaire  by age 25 and have a stable family. I was successful in that. I have the vision to built amazing WordPress team and product, I am doing that right now. </span></p>\n<p><b>I want to move on, I would like to see greater meaning of life. </b><span>That does not mean what I am doing is great, it&#8217;s just going beyond. I always thought life has a bigger meaning for me, I always felt privileged, the kind of life I had, most people from my demography could not have, so I have bigger responsibilities! </span></p>\n<h2><b>How &#8216;Big&#8217; is WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>WordPress is biggest CMS and No.1 solution to make Website, but how many businesses do you see worth over a $100M in WordPress Ecosystem? Or over $50M? Not much. And because of so much recent #WPDrama, one thing is very clear, we have a long way to grow. I kind of feel to make it too big, we even limited ourself as well. I do see the power struggle inside the community as well. The most respected person in the community, now have very large number of haters, and for few semi-valid reasons.<strong> That is sad, maybe we all need to rethink!</strong></span></p>\n<h1><b>What will I do in future?</b></h1>\n<p>Maybe I will <strong>drive deep into science</strong>, I will be still 34, even enough time to study something new! <span>Maybe I will just enjoy the break for awhile. Maybe I will try to find the better meaning of life. Or maybe will write a book, I don’t know, I want to keep the option open, have an open heart. I do certainly earn this freedom myself, I am very grateful to the list of endless great people that helped me throughout the decade of my career.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Your kids to reflect You!</b></h2>\n<p><span>We all want our kids to be like us, we want them to reflect us in a good way, and go beyond. But If we are not involved in every process of their life how could this happen? If you let your family, mainly wife to entirely take care of your kid how they are going to learn from you? Do you really believe just giving 1-2 hours a day will do the trick? It&#8217;s way more than that. I want to be an integral part of my kids’ life. I want to be fully involved in their process of growing up. In this whole thing, there is nothing related of deciding fate of their life. I have no expectation of making my kids something, I am fully open, they will decide their destiny, their own venture. I just want to help them understand this World, </span><b>be their Dad</b><span>, be the friend they could play with, be the teacher they need, as long as they need.</span></p>\n<p><span>I will spend more time with my family, my 2 young daughters really need more of me, they will be 4 &amp; 2 by next year. They will go into school, perfect time for me to jump in.</span></p>\n<h1><strong>Conclusion: For You!</strong></h1>\n<p>If you came this far reading this, you could probably tell I enjoyed writing! My routine hardly gives me more option to do it regularly. I was meant to write this HeroPress article last year but was too busy, and the timing was too near of the 2nd baby&#8217;s birth!</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect others to try to retire early, but having a choice in life is important. Try to look back. Why do you work? Is it because of earning money? Just to survive, just to sustain your family? This should not be the purpose of human life. I believe our Creator created us for a reason, <strong>we are not meant to live and die selfishly like an animal. There should be more meaning of life other than trying to buy luxury!</strong></p>\n<p>There is a Ted talk describing Humans, how evaluated to be Human, one of the core reason was we cooked, and gathered and stored food, so we spent less time like other Gorillas to try to find food and spend most of the days for that purpose. We cooked, it was easy to chew, and it gave us more free time, so we were able to innovate! Interesting theory, but surely intriguing.</p>\n<p><strong>Life is not always about achieving it all. It&#8217;s sometimes about the journey. You can&#8217;t always win. You have to learn from the journey and move on.</strong></p>\n<p>When I look back I do see, my decision to invest worked out many ways. <strong>As I diversified my venture it was a good move.</strong> I made many mistakes and described in details here as well, but I tried to learn and reflect that in my further life. I am who I am, because of the journey. I don&#8217;t regret any part of it. If I had the chance would I have done it differently? I don&#8217;t know, maybe that could be a different journey. My life is wrapped up entirely with WordPress, I am and will always be proud of that. But maybe I need to give myself a fair chance to see the world clearly. For past 13-14 years, I have worked every day on an average 14 hours of more, I still stay at the office for over 12 hours. But I don&#8217;t do it because I have to, I do it because I enjoy it. But this is taking too much of my life, I am too swamped up. This break is necessary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I really like to thank Topher &amp; HeroPress for giving me this opportunity and pushing me on writing this. I was very confused as it turns out this BIG. I thought it was just 2500-3000 words, I wrote almost on the fly, so was not looking at word count. Probably this is kind of my thing, if an idea is clear in my head, I don&#8217;t have issues putting it into letters.</em></p>\n<p><em>Topher told me this is twice the size of the previous longest essay in HeroPress. <strong>I am glad if you read it completely! That&#8217;s also an achievement!</strong> Then why not spent few second more to say Hi in the comments, so I could know who read this far!</em></p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Retiring%20Young%20From%20Bangladesh%2C%20Thanks%20To%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F&title=Retiring+Young+From+Bangladesh%2C+Thanks+To+WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/083017-150x150.jpg&description=Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/" title="Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/">Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 00:00:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"M Asif Rahman";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Akismet: Akismet and Drupal, Together Again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1960";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/08/29/akismet-and-drupal-together-again/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1569:"<p>Akismet is used on millions of WordPress sites, but it isn&#8217;t only used with WordPress.

We have challenges (user frustrations with publishing and customizing, competition from site builders like Squarespace and Wix) and opportunities (the 157 million small businesses without sites, aka the next big market we should be serving). It’s time for WordPress’ next big thing, the thing that helps us deal with our challenges and opportunities. The thing that changes the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic has been moving towards offering better support for small businesses with its 2015 <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce" target="_blank">acquisition of WooCommerce</a> and steady commercialization of Jetpack, with plans targeted at business owners. The company is poised to capture even more of the self-hosted small business market by allowing customers to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem" target="_blank">tap into WordPress&#8217; third-party ecosystem</a>.</p>\n<p>However, many vocal opponents to Gutenberg (and the changes that will come along with it) are concerned that the project is being developed chiefly to serve Automattic&#8217;s customers and corporate interests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg has been mainly introduced by one particular company which seems to be in urgent need to compete with other SaaS businesses,&#8221; WordPress theme development company owner <a href="https://www.mhthemes.com/" target="_blank">Michael Hebenstreit</a> said. &#8220;That’s fine, but then keep it as a plugin for at least 1-2 years, put it on WordPress.com (to gather real live feedback and usage data) and nobody will have any issues with that approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg addressed concerns that Gutenberg is being developed for Automattic&#8217;s customers in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587598" target="_blank">reply</a> to a similar comment on his post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There definitely is a contingent that seems to think that, but if you think through it logically it doesn’t make sense: if it were just to benefit Automattic it would be far easier and more advantageous to just do Gutenberg unilaterally in Calypso, where it would primarily benefit WordPress.com,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Doing it in wp-admin and core first involves a lot more discussion, public feedback, backwards compatibility concerns, and breaking a lot of new ground for how core uses Javascript, and because it’s in core the benefits will accrue to all hosts of WordPress, many of which directly or indirectly compete with Automattic. We are reading and trying to learn from all the negative feedback though, even when it’s from people who haven’t used Gutenberg much yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those who build websites for clients have voiced concerns about how Gutenberg will affect their businesses, whether the brand new interface will drive users away from WordPress. Developers and product owners are eagerly awaiting more answers on what it means for existing plugins and themes in the ecosystem, as the project has yet to iron out some of the more technical details regarding extensibility and support for metaboxes. This naturally raises concerns about Gutenberg&#8217;s timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready, not vice versa,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We still have target dates to help us think about scope and plan for all the supporting documentation, translation, and marketing efforts, but we’re not going to release anything until Gutenberg is something the team working on it agrees is ready.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress users have been conditioned to anticipate releases on a regular schedule but the new approach to core development will allow for the next major release to wait until the targeted features are ready. Mullenweg confirmed in the comments of his post that Gutenberg will ship with a legacy interface to offer backwards compatibility for PHP metaboxes that have not yet updated to be JS-powered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some things like toolbar buttons will definitely need to be updated to work with Gutenberg, other things like Metaboxes there will be no problem to provide a legacy interface for a few releases,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;But I would say that plugin authors should start updating their plugins in late September if they want to benefit from Gutenberg’s launch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the most prevalent concerns that remains is React&#8217;s licensing issues, which came to a head after the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook’s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses for Apache PMC members. Facebook&#8217;s engineering directors considered re-licensing the project but <a href="https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license" target="_blank">decided against it</a>, citing &#8220;meritless patent litigation&#8221; as the reason behind adopting the BSD + patents license. The WordPress project has yet to announce its stance on the decision.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We anticipated a decision on React around the Apache deadline (closer to now), will have more to announce about WP and Gutenberg’s approach here in the next few weeks,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>He also reiterated how invested he is in the WordPress project and ecosystem as a whole. His post elaborated on the many benefits he anticipates for plugin, theme, and core developers, agencies, users, and hosting companies. He challenged the WordPress community to see Gutenberg in the same light.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My life’s work is improving WordPress,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I firmly believe that Gutenberg is the direction that will provide the most benefit to the maximum number of people while being totally in line with core WordPress’s philosophies and commitment to user freedom. So keep giving us your feedback, and let’s push through the fear together. It’s worth a little discomfort to change the world.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 18:01:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 18:45:28 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 18:30:10 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130911040210";}', 'no');

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8BDWH3QG-1-video" width="632" height="342" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world?

Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

Our goals are to make editing posts with links more intuitive, make widgets easier for new users and more convenient for existing ones, and get many more people aware of and attending our community events.</p>\n<p><em>Four point eight is here<br />\nSmall changes with a big punch<br />\nBig ones come later</em></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4727";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:36:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"WordPress 4.7.4 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/04/wordpress-4-7-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 17:54:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"4.7";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4710";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:376:"After almost sixty million downloads of WordPress 4.7, we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of WordPress 4.7.4, a maintenance release.

The appearance of the new editor, codenamed “Aztec,&#8221; is very similar to the old one but is light years ahead of its predecessor in both speed and reliability. Aaron Douglas, iOS engineer at Automattic, announced the <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/a-brand-new-editor-for-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/" target="_blank">open beta for Aztec</a> today with a side-by-side comparison video of the old and new editors. A copy and paste test with 500 paragraphs on iPhone 6s demonstrates Aztec&#8217;s instantaneous response while the old editor takes two-minutes to render the text.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition to better speed and performance, Aztec&#8217;s use of OS-provided text controls makes it possible to offer full support for accessibility technologies like iOS’ VoiceOver and Android’s TalkBack. It also adds the ability to draft using dictation.</p>\n<p>Aztec introduces a new undo/redo tool at the top of the screen as a quick option for fixing mistakes. It also provides a simpler, more reliable experience using spell check.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/aztec-testing.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Aztec beta is available to all users in the latest updates of the app (8.0 for iOS, 7.8 for Android). After opening the app you will see a popup for enabling the new editor. It can also be toggled on/off by going to Me > App Settings and selecting &#8220;Set the Editor Type.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The mobile team has made it easy to test and give feedback without leaving the app. Tapping the &#8220;beta&#8221; button at the top of the editor will open a &#8220;What&#8217;s New in the Beta&#8221; page with a bug button at the top that you can use to report bugs and send feedback. At the moment, the beta does not support shortcodes or video and WordPress gallery features. Keep in mind that it&#8217;s not 100% ready for use and heavy users of the mobile apps are likely to discover glitches.</p>\n<p>Aztec is open source (GPL 2.0) and packaged as a rich-text editor component in its own GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Aztec-iOS" target="_blank">iOS</a> | <a href="https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Aztec-Android" target="_blank">Android</a>) so that developers can use it in their own applications and contribute code back to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Quite literally, there is nothing like this out there – every editor we could find uses a web view or has very limited support for any HTML,&#8221; Douglas said. &#8220;Our hope is the Aztec editor is seen as a component that can be used by many iOS and Android apps to provide a rich HTML editing experience. We feel that we could garner a bigger contributor base to the mobile apps simply because this component exists, is free and open, and is super awesome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project is a few months behind the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2017/04/08/introducing-the-aztec-mobile-editors/" target="_blank">schedule published in April</a>, which had open beta targeted for May and the full release for the end of this month. Depending on how well the beta testing period goes, users could see the new Aztec editor included in the mobile apps within the next few months.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 22:59:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"WPTavern: Hamilton: A Free WordPress Portfolio Theme for Photographers, Illustrators, and Designers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72881";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:107:"https://wptavern.com/hamilton-a-free-wordpress-portfolio-theme-for-photographers-illustrators-and-designers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3779:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/hamilton/" target="_blank">Hamilton</a> is a new portfolio theme released by Swedish designer and developer <a href="http://www.andersnoren.se/" target="_blank">Anders Norén</a> during his summer vacation. It was created for photographers, illustrators, designers, and image-heavy blogs. The theme displays portfolio items in a minimal, masonry-style grid with an optional tagline on the front page.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-white-black-1.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Hamilton has a pretty simple design at its core, so when it was more or less finished, I decided to add a couple of fun theme options to make it more customizable,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;The main one is the Dark Mode. With a click of the mouse in the WordPress Customizer, you can change Hamilton from dark text on a white background to white text on a dark background.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Customizer also includes a few other helpful options for portfolio sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a custom background image or color</li>\n<li>Replace the navigation toggle in the header with the Primary Menu on desktop</li>\n<li>Change two-column default post grid display to three columns on desktop</li>\n<li>Display titles in the post previews</li>\n<li>Add a title to front page when it&#8217;s set to display latest posts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The theme is beautifully responsive to various devices and screen sizes. Norén&#8217;s typography choices are clean and readable on mobile.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-on-mobile-e1500914561475.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Hamilton includes <a href="http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/offscreen-magazine-collection/" target="_blank">styles for the default WordPress image gallery</a> with more interesting options available to create complex galleries stacked with different numbers of columns. It also supports Jetpack&#8217;s Infinite Scroll module and has styles for blockquotes, pullquotes, and left/right/center aligned media.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hamilton-pullquotes.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>One of the most unique features of the theme is the <a href="http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/resume/" target="_blank">Resume template</a>. It gives users the option to add a simple resume to their portfolios, without having to add a plugin. The template uses basic HTML for formatting with h1 header tags, horizontal rules, and unordered lists. The template could use a bit more documentation, since not all users are familiar with HTML, but it&#8217;s a useful addition for simple portfolio sites.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/resume-template.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Check out a <a href="http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/" target="_blank">live demo</a> along with the <a href="http://andersnoren.se/themes/hamilton/style-guide/" target="_blank">style guide</a> to see the theme in action.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/hamilton/" target="_blank">Hamilton</a> is Anders Norén&#8217;s 15th theme approved for the WordPress Theme Directory.

Over the course of a few months he started going deeper into learning about writing WordPress plugins and produced <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/" target="_blank">Members</a>, a role management plugin for WordPress. The first major overhaul of the plugin came in 2015 with version 1.0&#8217;s expansion of features and a new UI for editing roles.</p>\n<p>Members has built up a user base of more than 100,000 active installs since it first <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/09/17/members-wordpress-plugin" target="_blank">launched in 2009</a>. Tadlock estimates that over the last couple years, 40% of <a href="https://themehybrid.com/" target="_blank">Theme Hybrid</a> customers are primarily there for support and small tweaks to the Members plugin. He decided it was time to begin investing more in the plugin and its community.</p>\n<p>Tadlock released <a href="https://themehybrid.com/weblog/members-version-2-0" target="_blank">Members 2.0</a> this week. The plugin manages core WordPress capabilities but 2.0 adds the ability for plugins to register custom capabilities. The labels for the capabilities can be internationalized so users can manage the plugin in their own languages in human-readable form.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-human-caps.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also adds the ability to use the WordPress editor for writing custom post error messages, making it easy to direct visitors to registration or other important information regarding access to the content.</p>\n<p>Members 2.0 lets users add multiple roles when creating a new user from the Add User screen. It also introduces the ability to bulk add or remove roles from users, even when multiple roles have been enabled.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-bulk-users.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version of the plugin serves some of its data using the WP REST API and a new setting was added to authenticate users who are accessing the REST API endpoints. This protects content from being exposed on sites that have the &#8220;private site&#8221; setting enabled. Tadlock plans to write a tutorial about what he has learned in integrating the REST API with the plugin.</p>\n<h3>Tadlock Aims to Monetize Members with Add-Ons, Renews Efforts to Develop a Community of Add-On Developers</h3>\n<p>Members 2.0 introduces a new Settings screen that ties in with Tadlock&#8217;s future plans to monetize the plugin. The new screen includes a view for add-ons. Tadlock has two add-ons available currently and has written an API for third-party developers to register their own add-ons to be visible on this screen.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/members-2-addons.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is to create some small add-on plugins,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;There&#8217;s already two:  <a href="https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-levels" target="_blank">Members &#8211; Role Levels</a>, which is paid, and <a href="https://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-hierarchy" target="_blank">Members &#8211; Role Hierarchy</a>, which I was hired to build and was allowed to release to the community for free. I&#8217;ve got a few small plugins like those in mind that&#8217;ll be in a lower price range.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock also plans to release a more robust version of the &#8220;Content Permissions&#8221; feature as another add-on. He has received numerous feature requests from users over the years about what they would like to see in this plugin. The add-on will offer a variety of different ways to show/hide content.</p>\n<p>I asked Tadlock if he has considered building payment gateway add-ons so users can charge for memberships. He said the idea is on the table.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to build those or someone else,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve mentioned it to some other developers. It would be a good place to start building add-ons.&#8221; His current setup uses Easy Digital Downloads with a couple of plugins to bridge it with Members and ThemeHybrid.com.</p>\n<p>A plugin like Members has the potential to have a large, third-party ecosystem of plugins for payments and additional features, but Tadlock was focused on other projects during the first few years after it launched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t actively pursued the add-on angle,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Instead, I focused more on themes during most of that time. Now, I&#8217;m focusing more on plugin development. It&#8217;s my fault for not nurturing a community of add-on developers, which is something I&#8217;m trying to do more of now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock said many of the developers he knows are working with Members because they like that it gives them a solid foundation to build on for client work. He hopes to persuade some of them to release some of that code back as commercial add-ons or free plugins in the WordPress plugin directory.</p>\n<p>Since launching the plugin eight years ago, Tadlock has aimed to make it behave as if it were a natural part of WordPress. At its core, Members is a role and capability management plugin and not a one-size-fits all membership plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more or less a UI over what you could do with code already,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Most of all, it tries not to get in your way. Every membership site has its own unique needs. It&#8217;s tough building something that suits everyone.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d rather have that foundation of Members just exposing the roles/caps system with third-party add-ons that suit various users&#8217; needs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other membership plugins often try to please everyone or pigeon-hole everything into their custom system. I like more to have a bit more flexibility without the bloat.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 21:37:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.1 Adds a Dedicated Custom HTML Widget";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73470";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-1-adds-a-dedicated-custom-html-widget";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2681:"<p>When WordPress <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-evans-released-featuring-nearby-wordpress-events-new-media-widgets-and-link-boundaries">4.8 was released</a> last month, it introduced TinyMCE functionality to the Text widget.

So far the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191" target="_blank">issue</a> has received 627 &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; emoji and 66 comments from concerned React users who are hoping for a change in licensing.</p>\n<p>Many respondents on the thread said that ASF&#8217;s decision affects their organizations&#8217; ability to continue using React in projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apache CouchDB and others will switch away from React if we have to,&#8221; CouchDB committer Robert Newson <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315596902" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d rather not, it&#8217;s a lot of work for no real gain, but we don&#8217;t have a choice. Changing license can be simple (RocksDB completed that change in a day).&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My team, at LinkedIn, is also having legal troubles using React for our internal projects,&#8221; LinkedIn software Denis Ivanov <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316500996" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We would love to see a change on this front.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Software developer Clark Evans <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315607798" target="_blank">commented</a> on how React&#8217;s current licensing might affect medical research institutes, and suggested that Facebook consider an Apache 2.0 license because it includes equitable patent grants.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since U.S. based universities rely upon patent licensing as part of their legislatively mandated technology transfer initiatives, they are growing far more cautious in their due diligence. For this reason, at some universities, software written with React may be shunned. Existing projects using React software may be asked to remove the React software software dependency. Please strongly consider this proposal, since our RexDB work is used at major universities, we do not wish to rework to use a React alternative.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several participants in the discussion commented that they would like to use React but the licensing makes it impossible for their companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other large companies such as mine (Adobe) can&#8217;t use React, Pop, etc. for the very same reason,&#8221; Corey Lucier <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316046522" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d love to participate in the project, contribute to each, etc. but Facebook&#8217;s heavy-handed PATENTS clause is a showstopper.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even mid-size companies like mine (ViaSat) are starting to disallow the use of Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;open-source&#8217; projects for this reason,&#8221; software developer Aaron Yoshitake <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316102045" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to build React web and native apps, but it seems that any sensible legal department will recommend against agreeing to Facebook&#8217;s asymmetric patent grant.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Internal Discussions Continue at Facebook, Re-Licensing Issue has been Escalated to Engineering Directors</h3>\n<p>Dan Abramov, co-author of Redux, Create React App, and React Hot Loader, shared with participants that Facebook is having internal discussions about the re-licensing issue but cautioned them to temper their optimism. He returned to throw some ice on the conversation, which has grown more heated over the past few days, when he said it could only remain an open discussion if everyone involved remains civil. Many participants are concerned about the future of the React-based software that they have already invested thousands of hours of work into.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that everyone is frustrated about this issue,&#8221; Abramov <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316223034" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;Personally I am just as frustrated to spend time, energy, and emotional wellbeing on legal mumbo jumbo that is preventing people from using React. I would much prefer to spend this time on working together to make it better.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But the reality of this situation is that the maintainers of React (people like me that you’re interacting on the issue tracker) are not the ones making these decisions. Each of us is doing what we can to show different perspectives on this issue to the people who can make those decisions, and we appreciate your feedback too. But we can only keep discussion open if everyone stays civil and respectful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also pointed out in a follow-up update that a bug tracker isn&#8217;t the best avenue for a legal discussion, especially since most participants are software developers and not lawyers. Many have mistaken the thread as a way to communicate with Facebook but there are just a handful of software developers who are representing the React community&#8217;s concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have heard you very well, and we have passed on your concerns,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;But repeating the same points over and over in different threads does not help move this forward, and creates a lot of noise and stress for the maintainers who are already empathetic to your cause.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants expressed frustration that the React community cannot participate in the discussions more directly. However, as React is both an open source project and a product of Facebook, the company&#8217;s leadership has the last word on licensing issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that software developers like us are not the best people to discuss legal details,&#8221; software consultant Erik Doernenburg <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316318170" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;However, wouldn&#8217;t the logical consequence be that the Facebook Legal team, who make such decisions, become active in this forum? Shouldn&#8217;t it be possible that all relevant details pertaining to a piece of open source software are discussed in the open? It is incredibly frustrating to have such an important aspect of open software discussed behind closed doors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not known whether Facebook is considering another change to its Patents grant or a complete re-licensing. Participants in the discussion are also concerned about other Facebook open source projects like GraphQL, Relay, React Native, and Flow, which share the same BSD+Patents License and are widely used by the open source community.</p>\n<p>Dan Abramov left an <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-316739812" target="_blank">update</a> today to let the community know that no resolution is available this week. However, the update seemed more positive than the first one, which discouraged participants from being optimistic about a change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to point out that there is a real momentum behind this discussion internally,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;There are going to be more meetings next week escalating this up to the engineering directors. As you imagine they are quite busy, so this is taking more time than we thought.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Again, I can’t promise you any specific conclusion, and there is no clarity on where this will land.

This is the third WordCamp to be held in Croatia, following WordCamp Rijeka (2015) and WordCamp Split (2016). Although it changes cities every year, the camp is known as Croatia’s annual WordCamp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having WordCamp change cities each year is quite normal for us,&#8221; WordCamp Croatia co-organizer and Zagreb meetup organizer Emanuel Blagonic said. &#8220;A lot of people from other cities travel to meetups too. Our largest meetup in Zagreb, which usually has 80+ people present and 100+ live stream viewers, usually has people attending from a 300km circle around Zagreb. People also travel to Split when there are meetups there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A renewed <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/07/18/regional-camps-take-2/" target="_blank">discussion on regional WordCamps</a> is firing up on the WordPress Community team P2 blog, as the topic was discussed at the Community Summit and with recent developments in <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-netherlands-reinstated-for-2018" target="_blank">WordCamp Netherlands being reinstated</a> and <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-asia-now-in-planning-for-2018-wordcamp-asia-targeted-for-2019" target="_blank">WordCamp Asia a possibility for 2019</a>. Croatia is another example of a country where a national WordCamp might benefit the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we started with organizing a WordCamp in Croatia, as a community we hoped that WordCamp will help us boost local communities, thus not having everything centralized in Zagreb (where most other meetups happen, i.e. PHP, Design, UX, JavaScript, Python, etc.),&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;As a community we strongly believe that every region is different and it should be viewed like that. So far we are organizing WordCamps &#8216;no matter what,&#8217; but having a &#8216;national WordCamp would mean more Croatian sponsors and better coverage from national media.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Zagreb will be a three-day event, beginning with workshops on the first day as the event has done in previous years. Organizers are planning for 12 workshops in four tracks that will be open to public registration. The main conference will be held Saturday with two tracks. Contributor Day will close out the event on Sunday, followed by a walking tour of the city.</p>\n<p>Friday&#8217;s workshops will be held mostly in Croatian, except a few, such as WordPress Basics and Public Speaking, which will be conducted in English. All of the conference talks this year will be in English.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Croatia is a tourist country and most of the people here speak good English, which is often used at large tech events,&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;With that in mind, every WordCamp so far was (mostly) in English, which means it’s quite welcoming for people outside Croatia, too (Slovenia, Austria, Italy, Germany) – and our community likes to meet new people. Unlike WordCamps, we see Meetups as strong local events so we usually have talks in Croatian there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Blagonic said every year so far the WordCamp has had approximately 20% of its attendees traveling from outside Croatia, as the country is relatively small with a population of 4 million. Most attendees travel to the WordCamp from other parts of Croatia.</p>\n<p>Croatia currently has five local meetups, but only the two in Zagreb and Split have enough members to meet regularly. Blagonic said he sees the meetups as a way to help local communities grow and views the WordCamp as &#8220;a celebration of the country community.&#8221; However, he believes centralizing the larger events too much would be detrimental to growing the fledgling WordPress communities in the smaller cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’d say that in Croatia (and in the region) we have a young democracy and we still haven’t found the best way to connect with people,&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;For example, there are four big cities in Croatia where most of the things happen, and the tech scene is quite strong in them. If you go outside of these four hubs, a lot fewer things happen, which is a problem for people living outside. We believe that having a centralized country is bad for growing local communities (outside these areas) so with changing cities each year and with traveling to other Meetups/WordCamps we hope that we will change how people feel about it. &#8220;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 18:11:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Donncha: WP Super Cache 1.5.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"https://odd.blog/?p=89500337";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"https://odd.blog/2017/07/19/wp-super-cache-1-5-0/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5935:"<p>WP Super Cache is a fast full-page caching plugin for WordPress. Download it from your dashboard or get it <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5.0 has been in development for some time. It has a ton of bug fixes and new features. </p>\n<h3>REST API</h3>\n<p>The headline new feature is REST API access to the settings. This will allow developers to create their own interface to the settings of the plugin. Unfortunately it isn&#8217;t yet documented but you can see the code <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/tree/master/rest">in the rest directory</a>. Start with load.php where you&#8217;ll find the code that registers all the endpoints. Users who access the API must be logged in as admin users. If you want to test the API, see the end of this post.</p>\n<h3>Settings Page</h3>\n<p>We have also simplified the settings page to make it easier to choose which caching method is used. </p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Instead of maybe confusing the user with technical words like PHP, mod_rewrite and WP-Cache we have split them up into &#8220;Simple&#8221; and &#8220;Expert&#8221; delivery methods, and done away with mentioning WP-Cache completely. Simple delivery uses PHP, expert uses mod_rewrite and well, WP-Cache got the boot because it&#8217;s always active anyway.</p>\n<p>WP-Cache caching is always active, but it can be disabled in different ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Disable caching for known users.</li>\n<li> Don&#8217;t cache pages with GET parameters</li>\n<li> Disable caching of feeds</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Headers</h3>\n<p>We <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/287">expanded the number of headers</a> cached by the plugin. The list of headers was borrowed from <a href="https://cometcache.com/">Comet Cache</a>. However, anonymous users will still only see the bare minimum like content-length or content-type. If you need to use security headers like &#8220;X-Frame-Options&#8221; or &#8220;Content-Security-Policy&#8221; you should enable caching of HTTP headers. This unfortunately disables super caching so only WP-Caching is used but it&#8217;s still very fast (and faster in this release than before which I will get to below). You can also use the &#8220;wpsc_known_headers&#8221; filter to modify the list of recognised headers.</p>\n<h3>WP-Cache Reorganisation</h3>\n<p>WP-Cache cache files are split into two files &#8211; one holds the page content, the other (meta file) holds information about the page such as cookies, headers and url. In the past these files were stored in two directories which could become a problem if there were many thousands of those files. Even with only a few hundred files, maintenance could be an issue as deleting related files (like page archives, or copies of the front page) needed every meta file to be inspected.<br />\nNow the files are stored in the supercache directory structure that mirrors your permalink structure. Deleting related files is is simpler and serving files will be faster as the operating system won&#8217;t need to open a directory of thousands of files.<br />\nIf you currently rely on WP-Cache files, the plugin will still look for them where they are, but new WP-Cache files will be created in cache/supercache/example.com/ (where example.com is your hostname).</p>\n<h3>Sitemaps</h3>\n<p>We added support for caching sitemaps, but your sitemap plugin will need to cooperate to get it to work. The sitemap plugin needs to identify the sitemap request as a feed. Jetpack 5.1 now supports this since <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/7397">#7397</a>. You can disable the caching by excluding feeds from caching.</p>\n<h3>Debugging Improved</h3>\n<p>The debug log is now protected by a username/password. For convenience, the username and password are the same but they are a long md5 string:</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Deleting the log file clears it and resets it ready for more logging. Before, toggling debugging would create a new debug log and the old one would be kept around, but not linked, until deleted by garbage collection, and of course they were text files anyone could access.</p>\n<p>This release includes lots of other small bug fixes and changes. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">number of closed PRs</a> for an exhaustive list of those changes!</p>\n<h3>Testing the REST API</h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways to send POST requests to a web server but one I like is using curl in a shell script. You&#8217;ll need two bits of information from the website:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> The &#8220;wordpress_logged_in&#8221; cookie from your browser.</li>\n<li> The wp_rest nonce which you can get by adding `echo wp_create_nonce( &#8216;wp_rest&#8217; );` somewhere on your site where you&#8217;re logged in. It&#8217;s good for 24 hours.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My test script looks something like this:<br />\n<code>export NONCE=''1234567890''<br />\nexport COOKIE=''wordpress_logged_in_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=1234567890''<br />\ncurl -v -X "GET" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-WP-Nonce: $NONCE" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -H "Cookie: wordpress_test_cookie=WP+Cookie+check; $COOKIE" \\<br />\n-d ''{}'' "https://example.com/wp-json/wp-super-cache/v1/settings/"</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href="https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href="https://odd.blog/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li><li> <a href="https://odd.blog/2010/02/08/wp-super-cache-099/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.9">WP Super Cache 0.9.9</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href="https://odd.blog/" rel="external nofollow">Source</a></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:25:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Donncha";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"HeroPress: Becoming Myself Again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1978";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:116:"https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-myself-again/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=becoming-myself-again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6018:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/071917-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: The WordPress community is, slowly but surely, helping me get rid of my ingrown fear of the unknown, of others." /><p>It’s so easy to become secluded and sit at home, in your own bubble, but it wasn’t until a group of people literally pulled me in with their welcoming atmosphere and demeanor, that I realised that I could function amongst other people as well (even if it was somewhat limited).</p>\n<h3>In The Beginning</h3>\n<p>To understand my bubble, you need to also know a little about me, or rather, about my childhood. I had a less than ideal childhood. I have a great family, lived in a great house, even in the “best country in the world” as they say. And despite this, I say I wasn’t happy with my childhood. My school years were the reason, they were rough. At times I think back and feel like events that unfolded were parts of ridiculous scenes from an over the top movie.</p>\n<p>All in all, the days seemed generic enough, except my school days were a thing of dread. I would suffer physical and verbal abuse throughout my schooldays, even going to and from school, I had no real friends (victim by association is understandably not something a child would want to intentionally walk into. I understand this as an adult, but as a child it’s not that easy).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Because of my treatment over the years, I developed trust issues, I got a fear for everyone around me, and it was growing stronger and stronger over the years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I suppressed it, I lied about it, and I got terrifyingly good at the lying part.</p>\n<p>This is why I was drawn to the internet: I didn’t have to interact with people, I didn’t need to go outside where the others were, I could just do my thing and move on. I could live in my own bubble.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>But then the darndest thing happened. I’d been stuck on a project, I needed help, and I turned to a support room for an open source project, for WordPress. If you’ve ever tried to get help in a chat before, you’ll know what kind of an experience it can be, the snarky reactions to your code, the nitpicking of using the wrong terminology, it’s not fun. This place though, they didn’t care that I was not only using the wrong terms, but my entire code was a horrible mess.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Where I would usually get the help I needed and move on, popping back in my bubble of solitude, I instead wanted to be like these people, I wanted to use what I learnt to let others get helped.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the years, I all but devote myself to that place. Nobody knew me, I liked staying under the radar, but eventually I got pushed into a team meeting. I was intrigued, so I would watch, I’d say hi, and progressively make my opinions heard. Yet, I would stick to my bubble, once the meeting was over I was back on my own.</p>\n<h3>And Then I Went To WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Until I got to attend my first big WordCamp, the last one held in San Francisco, I was ecstatic! I’d never been to a big conference before, as I didn’t like crowds, but I knew some of the people who would be there. They were people who had been friendly and inviting in the most genuine way imaginable. It’s not easy being worried whenever you’re out amongst people, but this group of people, this community, I didn’t have that fear around them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I somehow made WordCamps my safe space.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They are where I can, if only for a short while, leave that bubble, leave the need to be alone, and be a part of something great! I use them as fuel to get through the hard times, I can look forward to meeting people, people who value my opinions and my experience. People who genuinely want to listen and most of all, care about you! The WordPress community is, slowly but surely, helping me get rid of my ingrown fear of the unknown, of others.</p>\n<p>The community is helping me become myself again.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Becoming Myself Again" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Becoming%20Myself%20Again&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbecoming-myself-again%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Becoming Myself Again" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbecoming-myself-again%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbecoming-myself-again%2F&title=Becoming+Myself+Again" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Becoming Myself Again"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-myself-again/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/071917-150x150.jpg&description=Becoming Myself Again" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Becoming Myself Again"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-myself-again/" title="Becoming Myself Again"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/becoming-myself-again/">Becoming Myself Again</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:00:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Marius Jensen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"WPTavern: New WordPress Contributors Meeting Provides Opportunities to Ask Questions and Learn the Ropes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73007";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:115:"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-contributors-meeting-provides-opportunities-to-ask-questions-and-learn-the-ropes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2270:"<p>Contributing to WordPress or other open source projects can be intimidating for first-time contributors. Sometimes, all you need is a helping hand to overcome fear, intimidation, or other barriers.</p>\n<p>In 2013, with the help of Konstantin Obenland, a WordPress core developer, I overcame my fear and <a href="https://wptavern.com/i-contributed-to-the-core-of-wordpress-and-you-can-too">contributed my first patch</a> to WordPress.</p>\n<p>This is one of the principles behind a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/">new weekly meeting</a> that is geared towards new contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new contributors meeting is the perfect place to come if you are new to contributing to WordPress core and have questions,<em>&#8221; </em>Adam Silverstein, WordPress core contributor, said.</p>\n<p>Every Wednesday at 3PM Eastern Daylight Time, users can visit the #core WordPress Slack channel and ask questions related to patches, tickets, and review the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/good-first-bugs">good-first-bugs report</a> on Trac.</p>\n<p>The first meeting was <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/10/new-contributors-meeting-recap-july-5/">held on July 5th</a> where participants asked questions about working with Git in WordPress core, applying patches, and unit testing.

It allows users to roll back any WordPress.org plugin or theme to a previous version with just a few clicks and also <a href="https://wordimpress.com/beta-testing-wordpress-plugins-with-wp-rollback/" target="_blank">supports beta versions of plugins</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why the plugin is so popular. Navigating buggy updates is a natural part of life when maintaining a self-hosted website and not all users have a separate testing environment for their websites. This tool gives them a basic diagnostic tool and the confidence to apply updates knowing they can easily roll it back in case of a problem. Many reviewers cite the plugin as having been &#8220;a lifesaver&#8221; when applying WooCommerce or Yoast SEO updates that had unexpected results.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/apparently-not-working-for-themes-rollback-on-multisites/" target="_blank">lone one-star review of WP Rollback</a> was given because the user anticipated multisite compatibility and was unable to get it to work. That issue has been solved in the latest update.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordimpress.com/wprollback-wordpress-multisite/" target="_blank">WP Rollback 1.5</a> is fully compatible with multisite networks, giving super admins the ability to roll back extensions from the network plugin/themes screen or from the the plugins/themes screen of the primary site in the network. Sub-sites do not have the ability to roll back plugins and themes for the entire network. The UI for rolling back themes on the network admin screen is identical to the plugin screens, as multisite doesn&#8217;t have the fancy theme preview screen that single site installs have.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5 also adds the ability for users to preview the changelog for previous versions of a plugin. This makes it convenient for users to quickly view the changes for each version without leaving the admin.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rollback_changelog.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://wordimpress.com" target="_blank">WordImpress</a>, the folks behind WP Rollback, have considered adding core rollbacks and database savepoints, but both features have serious potential drawbacks that could turn it into a high support-demanding plugin. In its current state, the plugin is virtually support-free.</p>\n<p>Matt Cromwell, Head of Support and Community Outreach at WordImpress, said the team thought about monetizing the plugin in the beginning, but is not pursing any plans to do so at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think of it as just one of the many ways we are giving back to the WP community,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Our preference would be for the core team to consider it as a potential feature plugin for eventual core inclusion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cromwell said WordImpress hasn&#8217;t made any intentional steps to see if core folks are interested in WP Rollback becoming a feature plugin, but the team has purposely built it to be as close to core standards as possible. He believes it would be relatively easy to implement in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for new features, general feedback, and bug reports are welcome on WP Rollback&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/WordImpress/WP-Rollback" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. The plugin&#8217;s authors recommend backing up your site before using it to rollback plugins and themes or testing rollbacks on a staging site first. WP Rollback is not capable of rolling back changes a plugin update has made to the database, so a backup can come in handy if the database changes are incompatible with previous versions.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 22:24:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:136:"WPTavern: React Users Petition Facebook to Re-license React.js after Apache Software Foundation Bans BSD+Patents License in Dependencies";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73216";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:146:"https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9983:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/apache-software-foundation.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Apache Software Foundation <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303?focusedCommentId=16088663&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16088663" target="_blank">issued a notice</a> over the weekend, indicating that it has added <a href="https://code.facebook.com/pages/850928938376556" target="_blank">Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license</a> to its <a href="https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved#category-x" target="_blank">Category X list of disallowed licenses</a> for <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html" target="_blank">Apache PMC members</a>.

This should happen shortly and well ahead of August 31st. I&#8217;ll leave the history and philosophy around licensing alone since it&#8217;s generally a complex discussion to have and I&#8217;m not sure that it has actually been fully captured in this thread especially vis a vis Facebook&#8217;s intent.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this morning&#8217;s guidance to PMCs can be adjusted since I don&#8217;t think any of us see a bunch of extra engineering effort as a desirable thing across the ASF projects which are already making use of RocksDB</p></blockquote>\n<p>In light of the ASF Legal Affairs Committee&#8217;s decision to disallow the BSD+Patents License in Apache projects, ASF member Joan Touzet opened an issue on the React repository urging Facebook to consider re-licensing React.js under Apache License v2.0 and GPL 2:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThis has led to a lot of upset and frustration in the Apache community, especially from projects requiring similarly-licensed code as direct dependencies &#8211; the chief of these being RocksDB.</p>\n<p>We (the Apache Software Foundation) have just received word that RocksDB will be re-licensing their code under the dual Apache License v2.0 and GPL 2 licenses.</p>\n<p>As a user of React.JS in an ASF top-level project (Apache CouchDB), please consider re-licensing React.JS under similar terms. Otherwise, many ASF projects such as our own will have to stop relying on and building with React.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although the re-licensing of RocksDB solves that particular project&#8217;s problem, ASF&#8217;s ban of Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license means other widely used technologies from Facebook, including React.js, are still banned. This is likely to cause problems for many open source projects.</p>\n<p>Harshavardhana, from the <a href="https://www.minio.io/" target="_blank">Minio</a> team, commented in support of the petition to Facebook for re-licensing React.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our object storage browser UI is based on React and we are Apache 2.0 licensed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would be unfortunate and time consuming to migrate but we will have to do that in lieu of new information regarding Apache incompatibility. Please consider re-licensing React.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors to <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om" target="_blank">Om</a>, a ClojureScript interface for React, are also <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om/issues/882" target="_blank">discussing whether or not the ASF&#8217;s new requirements will affect their project</a>. Greg Stein, commenting on behalf of ASF, clarified the reasons behind the organization&#8217;s decision to ban Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Please note that the ASF chose this path for policy reasons, rather than &#8220;license incompatibility&#8221;. We don&#8217;t want downstream users of Apache code to be surprised by the PATENTS grant that (was) in RocksDB and (is) in React. Users should only need to follow the ALv2, with no further constraints.</p>\n<p>These license can work together (IMO) and simply provide two sets of restrictions upon users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stein said it was not ASF&#8217;s lawyers who made the decision but rather the organization&#8217;s policy decision to &#8220;disallow FB/BSD+Patent license to be mixed into the software the Foundation releases to users.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Facebook is Internally Discussing the Re-Licensing Matter</h3>\n<p>Dan Abramov, co-author of Redux, Create React App, and React Hot Loader, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-315707719" target="_blank">joined the discussion on GitHub</a> regarding re-licensing with a brief and ambiguous summary about how Facebook is handling the petition to re-license.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To give you a small update, there are going to be more internal discussions about this for about a week,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;This is about as much as I can say. I wouldn&#8217;t be too optimistic about this changing for React but we&#8217;ll see. @daveman692 has kindly agreed to provide an update when these discussions are over.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dropping the patent grant entirely, which would be the most convenient way of solving this issue for open source projects, isn&#8217;t likely to happen. React has already gone through re-licensing twice during its short history. It was originally licensed under Apache 2.0 but this was changed in October 2014 to the BSD License plus the patent grant, which included a highly controversial termination provision. In April 2015, the patent grant was changed slightly to allow licensees to continue to use the software in the event that a patent lawsuit did not include a counterclaim against Facebook or its affiliates in a matter unrelated to React.js.</p>\n<p>The termination provision in Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents License continues to be unpopular and is regarded suspiciously by many open source project maintainers. When the Drupal project began <a href="http://buytaert.net/selecting-a-client-side-framework-for-drupal" target="_blank">considering a client-side framework to supersede Backbone.js</a>, Dries Buytaert passed on React based on what he said was &#8220;a potentially unacceptable patent clause,&#8221; citing <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650" target="_blank">pushback from WordPress.com&#8217;s Calypso and React contributors</a>.</p>\n<p>The WordPress open source project has not formally announced its decision on which JavaScript framework will be included in core, but all signs point to React. WordPress&#8217; upcoming Gutenberg editor is built on React and its chief contributors are Automattic employees who work on React-based products for WordPress.com. Gutenberg continues to plough forward at a breakneck pace with no indication of a rewrite, and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg has been outspoken about his preference for using React.</p>\n<p>Although Automattic&#8217;s legal counsel has said the company is <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-will-continue-to-use-react-js-in-calypso-despite-patent-clause" target="_blank">comfortable using React for its product under the project&#8217;s current license </a>, others in the WordPress community are not as amenable to including the framework in core.</p>\n<p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) includes a generic <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent" target="_blank">BSD+Patent license</a> listed among its approved licenses, but Facebook&#8217;s particular BSD+Patent license has not been submitted. Robert Pierce, a partner at El Camino Legal, <a href="https://www.elcaminolegal.com/single-post/2016/10/04/Facebook-Reactjs-License" target="_blank">contends</a> that the license termination provision ought to be impermissible in an open source license because it exists to protect Facebook from patent litigation that is completely unrelated to React code:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Facebook touts React.js as open source software. But in my mind the license termination provision of the Additional Grant of Patent Rights takes the offering outside the realm of open source software.</p>\n<p>The patent license offered in the Additional Grant of Patent Rights (v.2) is conditioned upon the licensee not bringing a patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook or its affiliates. Thus, the licensee pays a price to use the library. It is not a price paid with money. The price demanded by Facebook for use of the library is that the licensee refrain from exercising any of its patent rights against Facebook or its affiliates.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pierce views Facebook&#8217;s publication of React source code as leverage to win some protection against patent lawsuits, which he deems to be &#8220;too greedy an approach for Facebook to claim open source status.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The open source community has widely speculated about the implications of including Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patent license as a dependency, but the license has not yet been tested in court. The Apache Software Foundation is the first major organization to take a hard line stance on the controversial license and this has caught Facebook&#8217;s attention. Facebook representatives have promised an update on the petition for re-licensing after its internal discussions have concluded.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 03:25:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Stylishly Display Weather Conditions with the Weather Atlas Widget";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73229";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"https://wptavern.com/stylishly-display-weather-conditions-with-the-weather-atlas-widget";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2207:"<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an easy way to display weather conditions on your site, check out the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/weather-atlas/">Weather Atlas Widget</a> by <span class="byline"><span class="author vcard"><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/weatheratlas">Yu Media Group d.o.o</a>.

Over the weekend Ahmad Awais released a new project called <a href="https://ahmadawais.com/gutenberg-boilerplate/" target="_blank">Gutenberg Boilerplate For Third-Party Custom Blocks</a>. Awais&#8217; introductory post includes a rundown of his thoughts on the current pros and cons of developing for the Gutenberg project. Although he appreciates the technology behind Gutenberg and the improvements over shortcodes, he is not fully sold on the concept of putting everything into blocks. To learn more, he decided to jump into the code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am still making up my mind with how Gutenberg will fit in the WordPress core,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;There are so many things which are both good and bad about it. So, instead of ranting about it, I wanted to do something more productive. I went ahead, studied the source code and received a lot of help from Gutenberg contributors (Matias Ventura, James Nylen, Riad Benguella, Andrew Duthie, Joen, etc.) to finally build a Gutenberg Boilerplate project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awais&#8217; <a href="https://github.com/ahmadawais/Gutenberg-Boilerplate/" target="_blank">Gutenberg Boilerplate</a> is a good starting place for learning more of the basics about developing for the editor. It comes in the form of a plugin that offers four examples of how to build different kinds of custom Gutenberg blocks, with and without a build process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A block with custom CSS for editor and front end</li>\n<li>A block with ES6 or ESNext and a Webpack build process</li>\n<li>A block with editable content</li>\n<li>A block to click Tweet the contents of that block</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, the tweet block, which is something that might previously been handled with a shortcode, is an example that includes four files: block.js to register the custom Gutenberg block, editor.css, style.css, and index.php.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4-gb.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Awais noticed that many developers were wanting to try building third-party blocks, but Gutenberg&#8217;s documentation for this was outdated and/or non-existent. He got involved in contributing to the project&#8217;s documentation after discovering the docs describing how to enqueue block and block editor assets were not available. This gave him the inspiration to create a boilerplate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Both as a theme/plugin developer, I think there’s going to be a steep learning curve here for just about everyone &#8211; users as well as developers,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;WordPress development just became very complicated with the Gutenberg project. I&#8217;m also not sure how devs will start writing extensions. Some users might expect them to keep the shortcodes for the old editor. Some might ask for blocks in the new one. Is there an API or back-compat? In short everything is changing and this change has both pros and cons.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These concerns also tie into the larger discussion around <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952" target="_blank">how Gutenberg can support legacy metaboxes that use the old PHP framework</a>, instead of updating to the new JS.</p>\n<p>&#8220;New metaboxes should be written in JS, and will appear in the Post Settings sidebar alongside the stock ones,&#8221; Gutenberg contributor Joen Asmussen said. &#8220;Metaboxes written in PHP should ideally be upgraded to be JS, but should continue to work in their PHP form also.&#8221; Asmussen has proposed an &#8220;Extended Settings&#8221; panel to house legacy metaboxes in a section below the editor. It would appear only when legacy plugins and metaboxes are enabled, as shown in the mockup below.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/extended-settings-mockup.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Discussion regarding how to support metaboxes is still ongoing. With so many important issues like this up in the air, it&#8217;s too early to know what the future of extending Gutenberg will look like. At the moment, the project is undergoing rapid development and changes, so extending Gutenberg may evolve drastically over a short period of time. If the editor is to preserve the same flexibility and customization opportunities of its predecessor, the project will need to ensure that it is easy to create custom blocks and extensions while continuing to support older PHP metabox infrastructure that is currently widely used.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 20:28:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.5.0 Adds New Verse Block for Poetry and a New Display for Recent Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72830";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-5-0-adds-new-verse-block-for-poetry-and-a-new-display-for-recent-blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5718:"<p>Another round of Gutenberg updates was released today. Last weekend brought <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/08/whats-new-in-gutenberg-july-8th/" target="_blank">version 0.4.0</a>, which didn&#8217;t have too many noteworthy visible changes on the frontend but introduced an API for handling pasted content. Gutenberg developers are aiming to have specific handling for converting pasted content from applications like Word, Markdown, and Google Docs to native WordPress blocks. Version 0.4.0 also added navigation between blocks using arrow keys and included a new approach for rendering embed frames.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14th-july/" target="_blank">Gutenberg 0.5.0</a> hit dashboards today. One major improvement to the writing flow is that the editor will now avoid showing block UI while the user is typing and/or starting a new paragraph in a text block. You can test this by typing and pressing enter twice to begin a new text block. No UI should be visible during this process. Small improvements like this one are gradually bringing a bit more zen to the editor, which is still full of confusing and surprising experiences.</p>\n<p>Version 0.5.0 adds the ability to upload images via drag-and-drop onto image block placeholders. The example below shows one of my tests. While the image is uploading, it fades in and out. This experience is a bit disconcerting, especially if the upload never resolves. I&#8217;m not certain this UI provides the best communication for the status of the image upload.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gutenberg-image-upload.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version also introduces a new Verse block, which is intended for poetry. It has a slight indent, as compared to a plain text block, but it doesn&#8217;t yet work well with copy and paste. Unless you are a poet composing in WordPress, it&#8217;s far more likely that you will be pasting in poetry content from somewhere else on the web. Other than the initial bugs, it&#8217;s a useful block for those who often post verse.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/verse-block.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With the growing number of block types, it can be cumbersome to sort through all of them when adding a new block. Gutenberg 0.5.0 implements a new display for recent blocks. A maximum of eight are shown and the most recently used ones are displayed at the top. It does not yet persist between editor sessions, but Gutenberg contributors plan to add that in the future.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/recent-blocks.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other notable improvements in this release include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1833" target="_blank">New tabs mode for the sidebar</a> to switch between post settings and block inspector</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1816" target="_blank">Display warning message</a> when navigating away from the editor with unsaved changes</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1872" target="_blank">Mobile implementation</a> of block mover, settings, and delete actions</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1852" target="_blank">Search through all tabs</a> on the inserter and hide tabs</li>\n<li>Enable <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1889" target="_blank">ability to add custom classes</a> to blocks (via inspector)</li>\n<li>Add <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1896" target="_blank">“table of contents” document outline</a> for headings (with empty heading validation)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Writing Long-Form Content with Gutenberg is Still a Frustrating Experience</h3>\n<p>Gutenberg in its current state is a long way away from being an editor that users would embrace for long-form writing. It still contains many unnerving bugs that steal user confidence. For example, when pasting in multiple paragraphs from a lorem ipsum generator, the editor gave me a white screen and I lost all of the content in my post. After a bit of testing I found that pasting in paragraphs one at a time worked.</p>\n<p>This kind of frustrating and unexpected behavior has caused many testers to wonder why it isn&#8217;t being referred to as alpha software instead of beta. WordPress contributor Jon Brown summed up this common sentiment in a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/08/whats-new-in-gutenberg-july-8th/#comment-32799" target="_blank">comment</a> on the 0.4.0 release post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s getting better, but it honestly still feels more like a 0.0.4 alpha than a 0.4.0 beta,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I’ve tried writing long form content several times with each version since 0.1.0 and each time I’m quickly frustrated by the lack of flow between blocks. It’s more frustrating than TinyMCE.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg needs to make significant progress before it can be suitable for writing anything more than a few short paragraphs. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to get into the flow of creating long-form content with the prominence of the block UI. Right now, the editor just gets in the way. The current UI is skewed heavily towards frequent block creation. It is clutter-some and distracting for pure writing tasks.

In March, the plugin <a href="https://wptavern.com/jetpack-introduces-theme-installation-from-wordpress-com-sparks-controversy-with-alternative-marketplace-for-free-themes" target="_blank">opened up access to all of WordPress.com&#8217;s free themes via the Jetpack Manage interface</a>. All signs pointed to Automattic developing the infrastructure to offer commercial themes via Jetpack upgrades. At that time, however, Jetpack team member Richard Muscat said that Automattic had &#8220;no immediate plans to sell themes at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yesterday those subscribed to the Jetpack Announcements email were notified that <a href="https://wordpress.com/professional-sites/" target="_blank">commercial themes have landed</a> in the <a href="https://jetpack.com/install/professional/" target="_blank">Jetpack Professional plan</a>, which is regularly priced at $24.92/month or $299/year. Customers will have unlimited access to more than 200 commercial themes that are already available on WordPress.com. Jetpack users on the free plan will see all the themes available in the WordPress.com theme browser with a prompt to upgrade for the ones that are commercial.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jetpack-themes.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The announcement also noted that any themes users elect to use will be automatically backed up and regularly scanned for malware as part of the security services included in the package. For those who are running a multisite network, each site will need its own Jetpack Professional subscription to have access to the commercial themes.</p>\n<p>For years the WordPress community has speculated about what Automattic&#8217;s long game was for Jetpack, and many believed it was only a matter of time before the plugin started offering commercial upgrades. It was <a href="https://jetpack.com/2011/03/09/blast-off/" target="_blank">introduced to the WordPress world in 2011</a>  as a way to provide feature parity between WordPress.com and self-hosted sites. The first version included just eight modules, but fellow plugin developer and entrepreneurs in the community were immediately aware of its commercial potential.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-powers-42-of-all-online-stores" target="_blank">identified both Jetpack and WooCommerce as “multi-billion dollar opportunities”</a> that could each individually be larger than WordPress.com. The plugin is now active on more than 3 million WordPress sites. Automattic&#8217;s aggressive commercialization of Jetpack in the past two years is the fulfillment of initial predictions about where the plugin was headed.</p>\n<p>The new commercial themes offering significantly raises the value of the Jetpack Professional plan, which was previously targeted at business users who require unlimited storage, Google Analytics, and additional SEO features. With the addition of unlimited use of 200+ themes, Automattic has expanded the Professional plan to be more compelling for non-business users who are simply interested in gaining access to a collection of professionally-supported themes.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 21:46:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.9.0 Release Candidate 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://buddypress.org/?p=267012";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://buddypress.org/2017/07/buddypress-2-9-0-release-candidate-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2980:"<p>Today sees BP 2.9.0 move to The final testing phase <strong>Release Candidate 1</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is the last chance to test out this release and report back any issues found before final release in approximately two weeks time.</p>\n<p>Any issues found can be reported to our <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/newticket"> trac ticket home </a>, or raised on the support forum.</p>\n<p>Amongst other improvements and fixes to look out for are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing display of older activity comments.</li>\n<li>Correction of message when removing friends that are not friends.</li>\n<li>Group invites &#8211;

Although most violations are unintentional, there are some cases where companies do not comply with the license in order to block competitors from developing similar software.</p>\n<p>GPL enforcement doesn&#8217;t often lead to litigation. When it does, most other avenues of resolving the complaint have already been exhausted. A lawsuit in the air transport industry is currently bringing more attention to the gravity of not complying with open source software licensing requirements.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.cokinetic.com/" target="_blank">CoKinetic Systems</a>, a developer and manufacturer of in-flight entertainment (IFE) software, has <a href="https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/nysd/470007/1-0.html" target="_blank">filed a case against Panasonic Avionics</a> that includes allegations of a fairly egregious breach of the GPL. The complaint alleges that Panasonic Avionics has monopolized the Panasonic IFE Software and Media Services Market by deliberately refusing to distribute the source code for its open-source Linux-based operating system:</p>\n<blockquote><p>More specifically, Panasonic has built the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software using the open-source Linux kernel, which is clearly governed by the GPL, together with Panasonic’s own modified Linux modules, which are likewise governed by the GPL. </p>\n<p>Indeed, Panasonic has itself affirmatively identified its own modified modules as being subject to the GPL, because the original Linux modules were specifically designed to generate warning messages if other code is linked with or otherwise combined with the Linux modules that are not licensed under the GPL. To suppress these warnings, Panasonic willfully acted to insert code into its own modules to indicate that they were licensed under the GPL.</p>\n<p>Panasonic has incorporated a massive amount of open source modules, programs, and libraries into the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software, without distributing notices or source code to the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software, or even to any part of it&#8230;By deliberately refusing to distribute the source code to the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software in accordance with its GPL obligations, Panasonic intentionally deprives competitors in the market from having the ability to develop software that can access the basic features and capabilities of Panasonic IFE Hardware.</p></blockquote>\n<p>CoKinetic Systems contends that Panasonic&#8217;s refusal to distribute its source code voids its GPL license and &#8220;potentially exposes Panasonic to billions of dollars in statutory damages for hundreds of thousands of hardware installations that willfully infringe copyrights belonging to hundreds or even thousands of software developers that freely contributed source code to Linux.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the complaint details how competitors have to rely on Panasonic&#8217;s APIs in order to offer software services to airlines using Panasonic&#8217;s IFE hardware, because they do not have access to the source code for the Linux-based core software. CoKinetic claims that Panasonic also deliberately blocks competitor products by its selective distribution of its APIs, resulting in stifled industry innovation and monopoly control over the Panasonic IFE Software and Media Services Market.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the worst and most grave allegation in the complaint is that, in addition to locking up the source code and doling out access to the APIs, Panasonic also maliciously sabotaged its own APIs in order to give the appearance that it is the only reliable software service provider for its hardware, which CoKinetic claims is inferior and sold at monopolistic prices.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Panasonic also is able to use its control over the Linux-Based Panasonic Core Software in order to make ongoing, undisclosed, and often malicious modifications to its source code, deliberately “breaking” Panasonic’s own APIs in order to purposely and maliciously sabotage the performance of third-party software products that Panasonic deems a competitive threat — particularly CoKinetic software.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the introduction to the case, CoKinetic cites a litany of anti-competitive conduct the company has engaged in over the past decade before detailing the current allegations. The case is not purely an open source license dispute, as the plaintiff also alleges that Panasonic abused regulatory processes, engaged in acts of corporate espionage, defamed CoKinetic, paid commercial bribes, and employed unlawful means to monopolize the Panasonic IFE Software and Media Services Market.</p>\n<p>CoKinetic is seeking compensatory damages for Panasonic&#8217;s GPL ongoing GPL breaches. The specific amount would be determined at the trial but the company believes it to be in excess of $100 million. The company also wants the court to compel Panasonic to publicly disclose and distribute the source code.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a case where distributing the source code is just a small sticking point or just a matter of principle. It has the potential to open up the IFE industry for faster progress and greater innovation. Many reading this article have undoubtedly used Panasonic&#8217;s IFE products when flying with the company&#8217;s customers, which include Emirates Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Virgin America, and United Airlines. With the source code available, airline customers could remove Panasonic&#8217;s software from their IFE hardware and replace it with their own software solutions.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/nysd/470007/1-0.html" target="_blank">complaint</a>, which was filed in the Southern District of New York in March, demands a jury trial. An initial pre-trial conference was held in May, but the case has been slow moving. The Court gave a deadline for the Defendant to file its motion to dismiss, but deadlines have since been extended. The Court also strongly recommended that the two parties retain a private mediator but it&#8217;s not clear how outside mediation could solve such a far-reaching matter that impacts so many vendors. <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/20747763/CoKinetic_Systems,_Corp_v_Panasonic_Avionics_Corporation" target="_blank">Additional documents</a> are due over the next few months, so it will be some time before there are updates on the progress of the case.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 04:39:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"WPTavern: AJ Morris Acquires iThemes Exchange";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=73071";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wptavern.com/aj-morris-acquires-ithemes-exchange";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3545:"<p>In 2013, iThemes <a href="https://wptavern.com/ithemes-launches-e-commerce-plugin-exchange">released Exchange</a>, an e-commerce platform that aimed to make selling online as simple as possible. Today, the company <a href="https://ithemes.com/2017/07/13/ithemes-exchange-new-home-exchangewpcom/">announced</a> that AJ Morris, Product Manager at Liquid Web, has taken over the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When approached about taking over iThemes Exchange early this year, we wanted to be sure the project and our customers went into very competent hands, someone who will love and care for them as much as we do,&#8221; Cory Miller, founder of iThemes, said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having spent four and a half years investing in the project and in you and your success, we did not take this lightly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After numerous conversations over the past several months, we believe the best home for Exchange is with ExchangeWP LLC led by AJ Morris.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Everything iThemes Exchange related will transition to <a href="https://exchangewp.com/">ExchangeWP.com</a>. Toolkit, Plugin Suite, Exchange Pro Pack, and iThemes Exchange Add-on customers will be given accounts for free support and upgrades through August 2018 at ExchangeWP.com.</p>\n<p>Beginning today, customers will no longer be able to purchase Exchange or its add-ons through iThemes as the company transfers licenses and products to ExchangeWP. However, iThemes will continue to provide customer support until the transition is completed, expected to happen in early August.</p>\n<p>Morris says he&#8217;ll continue to focus on making e-commerce simple and will provide regular updates to customers to provide insight into what goes into transition a product from one company to another and where the product is heading.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These days, it’s very easy to get WordPress up and running so you can start blogging,&#8221; Morris said. &#8220;But when you want to add e-commerce to the mix, it&#8217;s a bit different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;With big players like WooCommerce out there, it becomes too much too quickly for the average content producer to get their store up and running.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Exchange is going to continue focusing on the independent publishers that want to keep the revenue they can, while providing a simplistic experience in an easy-to-use e-commerce plugin that will help get their stores online quickly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Allowing Morris to take over the project frees up resources for iThemes to focus on three of its flagship products; BackupBuddy, iThemes Security, and iThemes Sync. In addition to their core products, the company says it will soon release a new project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My job as CEO is to be a steward of the time and resources we have at iThemes in order to serve you best,&#8221; Miller said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve realized for a while that it was past time for us to refocus our finite resources on the projects that have the most growth and potential for our company and you.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That meant we either needed to find a new home for Exchange or sunset the project.

This goes beyond the basic <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/publicize/" target="_blank">Publicize</a> functionality that automatically shares posts to connected accounts as soon as they are published, giving users the ability to automate their content marketing to social networks for the most optimal time for sharing.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/schedule-sharing.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to know how a post will appear on social networks once it has automatically been shared, which is one reason why many people choose to manually share a post for the best presentation. You want to ensure that the right thumbnail will show up with a message customized for each network&#8217;s particular audience. The new social scheduling feature on WordPress.com includes a built-in preview screen so users can see what the post will look like once it is shared to the network and then make any necessary tweaks.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/social-sharing-previews.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Scheduling social media posts is available on WordPress.com for Premium and Business plan users and for Jetpack Professional and Premium users. On the Premium plan level, which comes in at ~$9/month, users pay less than they would for scheduling apps like Buffer, Hootsuite, or Sprout Social while also getting access to more commercial WordPress features.</p>\n<p>To truly become a realistic replacement for these types of social media marketing apps, WordPress.com would need to offer better analytics tied into the new sharing feature to show how posts are performing at different times and networks. Although WordPress.com allows for unlimited scheduling and users, it would also need to allow sharing to more networks to be more competitive against these apps. For users who don&#8217;t need all of that data but just want the scheduling feature, a paid Jetpack or WordPress.com plan is a more affordable option.</p>\n<p>Several other self-hosted WordPress plugins already <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/schedule+social+media/" target="_blank">offer scheduling social media posts</a> for free and some even integrate the social accounts with Google Analytics. The addition of this feature to Jetpack commercial plans may not be as compelling for self-hosted users who can already find this for free, but it adds value for existing Jetpack customers who may now be able to replace a plugin or third-party service.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 19:59:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 281 – In Memory of Jesse Petersen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=73045&preview=true&preview_id=73045";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-281-in-memory-of-jesse-petersen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2501:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me/">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href="https://www.wpsteward.com/">Ben Meredith</a>.

Irving published a few insights from the discucssions that she and her colleagues are applying to their work at Open Collective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing money in open source is less controversial than we thought. The main issues are related to how.</li>\n<li>The coder role is only one among many equally important roles: community builder (for onboarding and creating a healthy ecosystem), documentation writer, fundraiser, and public advocate.</li>\n<li>Companies want to support open source communities. This is now more clear than ever.</li>\n<li>It’s easier for some companies to make in-kind donations rather than cash. We’re working on making this easier, and will share more about it soon.</li>\n<li>Projects that companies publicly support need to have accountability and respect codes of conduct, in order to avoid PR nightmares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the day following the event, SustainOSS organizers tweeted out a link to <a href="https://github.com/sustainers/discussions" target="_blank">a new forum on GitHub for discussing open source sustainability</a>. Proposed topics include fundraising, governance, contributor retention, productivity, and managing corporate relationships. It was created to offer a safe place for open source sustainers to collaborate with each other in the open and contributors have already submitted some practical ideas for discussion, such as <a href="https://github.com/sustainers/discussions/issues/4" target="_blank">adding a standardized FUNDING or SUSTAINABILITY file to repositories</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Busy day, got a lot done.

The basic population, as well as technological development, is concentrated in the central part of the country, in &#8220;city-states&#8221;: Moscow and St. Petersburg. Other regions are much less developed: lower wages, worse and more expensive infrastructure, fewer IT-vacancies and activities.</p>\n<p>I was born and grew up in a remote part of Russia &#8211; in the Far East, in one of the industrial cities, which is located in 7 time zones and 9000 kilometers from Moscow. The Internet, like other technologies, reached there with a significant delay and for a lot of money (unlimited Internet at a speed of 64 kb/s appeared only in 2007), Therefore, at first, the basics of site building had to be learned in snatches with the help of dial-up.</p>\n<p>The first site I did in school. It was built using simple HTML and CSS. But even in this form, it was very impressive and exciting. Then such sites were popular and periodically on the Internet I <a href="http://softphoenix.narod.ru/about.htm">met guys</a> of my age who like me comprehended the science of site building.<br />\nI was lucky to find a like-minded person, with whom we were able to develop together for some time and even launch a joint website.<br />\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1963 size-full" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png" alt="" width="962" height="637" /></a></p>\n<h3>University and start of work</h3>\n<p>Admission to the computer faculty of the university allowed to more specifically address the issues of web development: to learn PHP and MySQL, to get acquainted with a couple of CMS and to make <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100207131804/http://www.compnot.ru:80/">my first blog</a> on WordPress :). As far as I remember, the blog worked on some WordPress assembly using version 2.9. If you count from that moment, it turns out that I somehow have been working with WordPress for almost 8 years.</p>\n<p>In those days, <a href="http://ru.wordpress.org">ru.wordpress.org</a> was just born and there was no main site on the Russian-language Internet. It was a time of amateur assemblies, amateur translations and even <a href="http://book.max-3000.com/page/istorija-sozdanija">alternatives of WordPress</a>, aimed to the Russian segment of the Internet.</p>\n<p>By the will of fate, my first place of work related to website development was the web studio that used Joomla and Drupal. Then there were a few more places of work, during which time WordPress then turned into the main working tool, then returned to the category of extra work and hobbies.</p>\n<p>The turning point was the decision to move to Moscow and a full transition to WordPress in freelance format.</p>\n<h3>Moving to Moscow</h3>\n<p>The scenario of moving to Moscow or St. Petersburg is quite popular among IT specialists of my native region. This is a great chance to find interesting and highly paid job, get acquainted with a lot of IT specialists, including narrow ones, and develop in the area of interest.</p>\n<p>In Moscow, I moved with remote work and I do not have personal experience of employment in this city, but my wife and most of the acquaintances were satisfied with the options found.</p>\n<p>After about six months of living in Moscow, I was even more thirsty for adventure — to become a freelancer and completely concentrate on WordPress. The ability to plan time independently gives additional space for maneuvers and time for reflection. In my case, this led to an increase in activity in the WordPress community.</p>\n<h3>Participate in the WordPress community</h3>\n<p>Actively participate in the life of the community, I started about 1.5 years ago. Initially, these were the replies at the support forum, then the development of my plugins, after which I decided to try myself in translating the extensions into Russian and recording training videos for Russian-speaking users.</p>\n<p>Over time, it turned into a kind of hobby or even a way of life. Every day I read a lot of posts from users on the support forums and try to help resolve their issues, check and correct the added translation lines, periodically record and post training videos.</p>\n<p>Communication with users is very helpful. You are one of the first to learn about the problems and ways to solve them, you can quickly correct some incorrect or incorrect translation. Also, over time, a list of popular questions accumulates, which can be turned into training articles and videos. In turn, the creation of articles and videos helps to structure knowledge and understand the details.</p>\n<p>On <a href="http://ru.wordpress.org">ru.wordpress.org</a> a great team of moderators and translation editors has gathered. We regularly communicate in Slack, some I meet on WordCamp.</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1967" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Denis and Sergey" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>\n<p>In November 2016 I took part in the Global Day of Translation 2. It was an unusual experience: broadcasting from around the world, feeling the scale of what was happening and the excitement of the translation. At that time we took 6th place as the most active locale and attracted 7 new translators.</p>\n<h3>Meetups and WordCamp</h3>\n<p>In Russia there are not so many cities where WordPress-meetups are held, and WordCamp is held only in Moscow. But despite all this, these events are a great opportunity to be among WordPress lovers, to see live people with whom I have only spoken on the network before, and just feel the spirit of WordPress :).</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1968 size-full" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg" alt="Three big cheery guys at WordCamp" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>\n<p>This year I plan to visit WordCamp Moscow for the third time. I visit WordCamp as a participant, but I hope someday I will find a topic close to me and I will decide to apply for a presentation :). I think it will be interesting.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>At the moment I&#8217;m a full-time freelancer. This allows me to quite well combine work and activities in the community. I like to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkgL32ycnfl1hs0nJJD6Og">share knowledge</a> and make WordPress more accessible for Russian users.</p>\n<p>Many resources of WordPress are dominated by English, and some, for example, as <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/">developer.wordpress.org</a> or &#8220;Handbook&#8221; are not available for localization. I hope, in the future this will change and we will be able to expand our activities.</p>\n<p>In any case, WordPress remains the place where you can find yourself and help make life a little better for yourself and the rest of the participants.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id="russian">Как я нашел себя в WordPress</h1>\n<h3>Про Россию и знакомство с технологиями</h3>\n<p>Россия очень большая и очень разная страна. Основное население, как и технологическое развитие, сосредоточено в центральной части страны, в &#8220;городах-государствах&#8221;: Москве и Санкт-Петербурге. Остальные регионы развиты значительно слабее: ниже зарплаты, хуже и дороже инфраструктура, меньшее количество IT-вакансий и мероприятий.</p>\n<p>Я родился и вырос в отдаленной части России — на Дальнем Востоке, в одном из промышленных городов, который расположен в 7 часовых поясах и 9000 километров от Москвы. Интернет, как и другие технологии, доходили туда с существенным опозданием и за большие деньги (безлимитный интернет на скорости 64 кб/сек появился только в 2007 году), поэтому, по началу, азы сайтостроения приходилось познавать урывками с помощью dial-up.</p>\n<p>Первый сайт я сделал ещё в школе. Он был построен на простейшем HTML и CSS. Но даже в таком виде, это было очень впечатляюще и захватывающе. Тогда такие сайты были популярны и, периодически на просторах интернета, я <a href="http://softphoenix.narod.ru/about.htm">встречал ребят</a> моего возраста, которые, как и я, постигали науку сайтостроения.</p>\n<p>Мне повезло найти единомышленника, с которым мы смогли некоторое время вместе развиваться и даже запустить совместный сайт.</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1963" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img1-min.png" alt="Very old style web site." width="962" height="637" /></a></p>\n<h3>Университет и начало работы</h3>\n<p>Поступление на компьютерный факультет университета позволило более предметно заняться вопросами веб-разработки: изучить PHP и MySQL, познакомиться с парой CMS и завести <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100207131804/http://www.compnot.ru:80/">свой первый блог</a> на WordPress :). Насколько я помню, блог работал на какой-то сборке WordPress, использующей версию 2.9. Если вести отсчет с того момента, то получается, что я так или иначе работаю с WordPress уже почти 8 лет.</p>\n<p>В те времена <a href="http://ru.wordpress.org/">ru.wordpress.org</a> только зарождался и в русскоязычном интернете не было какой-то основной площадки. Это было время любительских сборок, любительских переводов и даже <a href="http://book.max-3000.com/page/istorija-sozdanija">альтернатив WordPress</a>, ориентированных на русский сегмент интернета.</p>\n<p>Волею судеб, моим первым местом работы, связанным с разработкой сайтов, стала веб-студия, использовавшая Joomla и Drupal. Затем было ещё несколько мест работы, в течение которых WordPress то превращалась в основной рабочий инструмент, то возвращалась в разряд дополнительной работы и хобби.</p>\n<p>Переломным моментом стало решение о переезде в Москву и полный переход на WordPress в фриланс-формате.</p>\n<h3>Переезд в Москву</h3>\n<p>Сценарий переезда в Москву или Санкт-Петербург достаточно популярен среди IT-специалистов моего родного региона. Это отличный шанс найти интересную и высокооплачиваемую работу, познакомится со множеством IT-специалистов, в том числе узких, и развиться в интересующей области.</p>\n<p>В Москву я переезжал вместе с удаленной работой и у меня нет личного опыта трудоустройства в этом городе, но моя жена и большинство знакомых остались довольны найденными вариантами.</p>\n<p>Примерно через полгода проживания в Москве, меня обуздала ещё большая жажда приключений — стать фрилансером и полностью сосредоточиться на WordPress. Возможность самостоятельно планировать время дает дополнительное пространство для маневров и время на размышления. В моем случае, это привело к увеличению активности в сообществе WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Участие в сообществе WordPress</h3>\n<p>Активно участвовать в жизни сообщества я начал примерно 1.5 года назад. Вначале это были ответы на форуме поддержки, затем разработка своих плагинов, после чего я решил попробовать себя в переводе расширений на русский язык и записи обучающих видео для русскоязычных пользователей.</p>\n<p>Со временем это превратилось в некое хобби или даже образ жизни. Каждый день я читаю множество сообщений от пользователей на форумах поддержки и пытаюсь помочь решить их вопросы, проверяю и корректирую добавленные строки перевода, периодически записываю и выкладываю обучающие ролики.</p>\n<p>Общение с пользователями очень помогает. Ты одним из первых узнаешь о проблемах и способах их решения, можешь оперативно исправить какой-то неверный или некорректный перевод. Также, со временем накапливается список популярных вопросов, которые можно превращать в обучающие статьи и ролики. В свою очередь, создание статей и видео помогает структурировать знания и разобраться в деталях.</p>\n<p>На <a href="http://ru.wordpress.org/">ru.wordpress.org</a> собралась отличная команда модераторов и редакторов переводов. Мы регулярно общаемся в Slack, некоторых я встречаю на WordCamp.</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1967" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img2-min-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Denis and Sergey" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>\n<p>В ноябре 2016 я принимал участвовали в Глобальном дне перевода 2. Это был необычный опыт: трансляции со всего света, ощущение масштабности происходящего и азарта перевода. В тот раз мы заняли 6 место как самый активный язык и привлекли 7 новых переводчиков.</p>\n<h3>Митапы и WordCamp</h3>\n<p>В России не так много городов, где проводятся WordPress-митапы, а WordCamp проводится только в Москве. Но не смотря на всё это, данные мероприятия — отличная возможность побыть среди любителей WordPress, увидеть в живую людей, с которыми до этого общался только по сети, и просто почувствовать дух WordPress :).</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1968" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img3-min.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>\n<p>В этом году я планирую посетить WordCamp Moscow в третий раз. Я посещаю WordCamp как участник, но надеюсь когда-нибудь найду близкую мне тему и решусь подать заявку на выступление :). Я думаю, это будет интересно.</p>\n<h3>Заключение</h3>\n<p>На данный момент я — фул-тайм фрилансер. Это позволяет мне достаточно неплохо совмещать работу и деятельность в сообществе. Мне нравится <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkgL32ycnfl1hs0nJJD6Og">делиться знаниями</a> и делать WordPress доступнее для русскоязычных пользователей</p>\n<p>На многих ресурсах WordPress преобладает английский язык, а некоторые, например, как <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/">developer.wordpress.org/</a> или &#8220;Handbook&#8221; вовсе недоступны для локализации. Надеюсь, в будущем это изменится и мы сможем расширить свою деятельность.</p>\n<p>В любом случае, WordPress остается тем местом, где можно найти себя и помочь сделать его чуточку лучше для себя и остальных участников.</p>\n<h2>участник</h2>\n<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1961" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/photo-min-300x300.jpg" alt="Denis Yanchevskiy" width="300" height="300" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Денис Янчевский</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://denisco.pro/">http://denisco.pro</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://twitter.com/dyanchevskiy">@dyanchevskiy</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.tv/speakers/denisco/">WordPress.tv</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/denisco/">WordPress.org Profile</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: How I found myself in WordPress &#8211;

The company&#8217;s logo has been listed on the <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/" target="_blank">Save Net Neutrality</a> event website for some time but it had yet to announce how it would be participating.

Unlike the existing plugins that support the event on July 12 by presenting visitors with a banner to raise awareness, Automattic&#8217;s plugin simulates what life might be like in the &#8220;slow lane&#8221; if the FCC abandons the principle of net neutrality. It replaces a few of the posts on your site with a “Still Loading” spinner. This plugin doesn&#8217;t seem to offer a way to test it ahead of the event, but it essentially displays a message at the bottom of your website and slows down some of your posts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/net-neutrality-plugin.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin will automatically be disabled after the event has concluded, so both WordPress.com and self-hosted users do not have to worry about turning it off and can remove it later.

VersionPress will automatically detect the definition file as long as each plugin has a .versionpress folder in it.</p>\n<p>With the release of 4.0 Beta, Bernard says a <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues/1243">repository</a> containing plugin definitions is next on the list and is encouraging plugin authors to contribute to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The final step is to have an online repository of the definitions,&#8221; Bernard said. &#8220;It will be open to anyone to contribute, not just plugin authors, and used by VersionPress transparently.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For insight on how to create definitions, developers can look at <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/tree/aba96d3f63bc5d84d49019bffa47252f87734288/plugins/versionpress/.versionpress">WordPress core</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pavelevap/versionpress-for-woocommerce">WooCommerce</a> for real-world examples.</p>\n<p>Other major changes include full support for WordPress 4.7 and 4.8, adoption of <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/projects/2">GitHub projects</a> to help manage the development process, and <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues?q=project%3Aversionpress%2Fversionpress%2F2+sort%3Acreated-desc+label%3Abug">a number of bugs fixed</a>.</p>\n<p>Developers and users can download <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/releases/tag/4.0-beta">4.0 Beta</a> from GitHub.

Lift founders Chris Wallace and Brad Miller will join 10up&#8217;s 120+ person distributed team, along with Lift&#8217;s director of technology, Christian Chung, and front-end developer Anthony Garand.</p>\n<p>10up is acquiring the Lift UX brand, hiring four team members, and will also take possession of <a href="https://remotejobs.com/" target="_blank">RemoteJobs.com</a>, which will continue operating independently as a remote job board. The Lift UX brand will be dissolved and clients and projects are in the process of transitioning over to 10up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were always looking for agencies to partner with and when I reached out to 10up I was looking to build a relationship to help work on UX design projects,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;10up has a strong engineering background and I felt like having them as a partner would be huge for our agency. Jake and I quickly realized that Lift UX and 10up had so many similar processes that it sounded like our two companies were the same but just different in size.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With similar expertise serving large clients in the WordPress space, the two companies were bound to end up competing on different projects, which happened during the course of their conversations spanning a year leading up to the deal. Miller said 10up founder Jake Goldman proposed a merger/acquisition type of approach.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I ended up speaking to them off and on for the next couple of weeks and things got pretty serious when we were competing for some projects,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;I was of course flattered by the offer. Jake and John were awesome. We enjoyed our conversations and decided to do an onsite to discuss things in more detail. They made an offer after our onsite and Chris and I decided to accept it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 10up&#8217;s announcement, Goldman said it &#8220;takes a special kind of chemistry and alignment for a deal like this to work.&#8221; The company&#8217;s acquisition of Lift is one of the biggest design-driven acquisitions in the WordPress ecosystem in awhile.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Adding more experience design expertise to our company DNA enhances our empathy and ability to collaborate with design partners in an era of interactive, responsive design where divisions between &#8216;design&#8217; and &#8216;engineering&#8217; have eroded,&#8221; Goldman said.</p>\n<p>Miller, who has worked with Wallace to build Lift into a top-notch design and user experience agency, said that securing design talent is a challenge in the industry. 10up adding a fellow competitor to its team is a stretegic move when design talent is in short supply.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s certainly hard to find quality talent that&#8217;s interested in a full time position,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;There are some amazing designers out there but a lot of them are contractors/freelancers. 10up wanted to find a team that had a big focus on quality design and UX. It didn&#8217;t hurt that we were big on WordPress either.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Miller and Wallace founded Lift UX in 2009 and will be closing out a chapter of their entrepreneurial lives as the brand dissolves into 10up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically we&#8217;ll fade into the 10up brand bringing along our team, portfolio, accolades, and ultimately our personality,&#8221; Miller said.</p>\n<p>Wallace said closing out this chapter is &#8220;definitely bittersweet,&#8221; but the team is excited to transition into 10up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a 6-7 person agency, we were all constantly being pulled in a million different directions,&#8221; Wallace said. &#8220;Joining 10up allows us to focus on our individual areas of specialization and excel in each. I love many aspects of entrepreneurship and small agency ownership but the idea of focusing on the success of the experience design team at 10up is something I am looking forward to.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:02:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Donncha: Thank you Translators!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"https://odd.blog/?p=89500320";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"https://odd.blog/2017/07/11/thank-you-translators/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1384:"<p>Well, well. <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-super-cache">WP Super Cache translations</a> are coming along well. 100% of strings in the development version are translated into Canadian English and Romanian!

We&#8217;re still shipping translation files but I think the release after that may ship without and rely entirely on the up-to-date online translations.</p>\n<p>So, thank you so much to the translators.

Both support the upcoming Save Net Neutrality event and are based on the <a href="https://github.com/fightforthefuture/battleforthenet-widget" target="_blank">official Fight for the Future widget</a> for the campaign.</p>\n<p>The widget will not display until July 12, so you can add a plugin ahead of time. If you want to test it to see what it will look like on the day of action, you can append #ALWAYS_SHOW_BFTN_WIDGET to your site URL after installing one of the plugins.

Earlier this year, the web passed a major milestone of getting <a href="https://wptavern.com/more-than-50-of-web-traffic-is-now-encrypted" target="_blank">more than 50% of traffic encrypted</a>. Let&#8217;s Encrypt has been a major contributor to that percentage growing to nearly 58%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Let’s Encrypt’s service first became available, less than 40% of page loads on the Web used HTTPS,&#8221; ISRG Executive Director Josh Aas said. &#8220;It took the Web 20 years to get to that point. In the 19 months since we launched, encrypted page loads have gone up by 18%, to nearly 58%. That’s an incredible rate of change for the Web.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Aas also announced that <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018.html" target="_blank">wildcard certificates are coming to Let&#8217;s Encrypt in 2018</a>. Wildcard certificates allow a site to secure an unlimited number of subdomains with the same certificate.</p>\n<p>Currently, the process to get Let&#8217;s Encrypt working on a WordPress multisite installation is much more complicated than adding a certificate for a single domain. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-encrypt/" target="_blank">WP Encrypt</a> plugin claims multisite and multi-network compatibility but super admins have often run into failure on networks with higher numbers of sites. Wildcard support for Let&#8217;s Encrypt will provide a better way to secure multisite networks.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s Encrypt will offer the wildcard certificates via the new <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/06/14/acme-v2-api.html" target="_blank">ACME v2 API endpoint</a> and will start by supporting base domain validation via DNS with the possibility of adding other validation options in the future. ACME is the protocol that Let&#8217;s Encrypt developed to allow subscribers to acquire and manage certificates. Those using the v1 endpoint are encouraged to move to v2 as soon as it&#8217;s available in January 2018. The v2 protocol was developed to be an IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standard so that ACME can work with more certificate authorities in the future.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 18:32:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"WPTavern: WangGuard Plugin Author Shuts Down Splog Hunting Service Due to Trauma and Death Threats";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72733";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:109:"https://wptavern.com/wangguard-plugin-author-shuts-down-splog-hunting-service-due-to-trauma-and-death-threats";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6853:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wangguard.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After seven years of developing and supporting the WangGuard/SplogHunter service, José Conti has <a href="https://www.joseconti.com/2017/07/03/la-verdadera-razon-del-cierre-wangguard/" target="_blank">shut down the server permanently</a> due to the stress and trauma associated with maintaining it. Conti is a WordPress plugin developer and consultant, and a member of the WordPress España translation team. His <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wangguard/" target="_blank">WangGuard plugin</a> identifies and blocks sploggers, unwanted users, and untrusted users on WordPress, Multisite, BuddyPress, bbPress, and WooCommerce sites. It is currently active on more than 10,000 sites.</p>\n<p>Speculation about why the service shut down was running rampant after Conti had <a href="https://wptavern.com/wangguard-plugin-launches-indiegogo-campaign-to-fund-development-and-support" target="_blank">collected donations via an Indiegogo campaign in October 2016</a> to fund support and server costs. Since that time SiteGround stepped in to sponsor WangGuard, eliminating the server costs. The only costs that remained were Conti&#8217;s time and effort that he put into supporting the plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My purpose with WangGuard was never money,&#8221; Conti said in his post explaining the reason for the shut-down. &#8220;I could have made WangGuard a paid plugin at anytime, and actually had a plan for that for years. But I didn’t do it because there is something inside me that would never let that happen. It was never, I repeat, never my plan to get rich with WangGuard, and I assure you that I could have done it easily: simply charging each of my users 24€/year, would have meant an income of more than 2 million euros per year. I just had to distribute a version of WangGuard I had collecting dust, with a checkbox on WangGuard’s server administration options but I never got it done. No matter the other reasons, which only people very close to me know: I simply didn’t want to, nor did I want to be a millionaire.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Mafia Death Threats and Trauma from Exposure to the Dark Web: The High Cost of WangGuard&#8217;s 99.9% Accurate Detection of Splogs</h3>\n<p>WangGuard has long been known for its nearly perfect detection of registration spam. Not only did it completely block unwanted users, it also removed them from the database. The plugin was unrivaled in both accuracy and price &#8211; all users got everything the service offered for free. In order for WangGuard to provide its 99.90% accuracy, Conti bolstered the algorithm with manual curation and reviews.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WangGuard worked in two different ways: as an algorithm that I had been refining for seven years, and which was getting better as the sploggers evolved, so that it was always one step ahead of them, and also as human curation, in which I reviewed many factors, among them sites of sploggers to see if their content could improve the algorithm and make sure that it worked correctly both when it was blocking or not blocking a site,&#8221; Conti said. &#8220;The great secret of WangGuard was this second part. Without it WangGuard would not ever have become what it was.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because of how effective WangGuard was at stopping unwanted users, Conti said for four years he received &#8220;almost daily death threats from mafias for making them lose millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Through the process of manually curating splogger sites, Conti caught a glimpse of the some of the darkest places on the web, which he said had a damaging psychological impact on him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For seven years, I have visited places where I saw pederasty, pictures, and videos of murders (by razor blades, by gutting live people, by beheadings, dismemberments, to name a few), real videos of rape of all kinds (children, women, boys), photos of accidents in which people were totally disfigured, bizarre actions that I did not even know existed, and a very long &#8216;and so on,&#8217; which I do not want to expand on,&#8221; Conti said.</p>\n<p>The effects of viewing these types of websites every day took their toll and Conti decided to close the splog hunter service.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Finally, a few months ago, I broke down,&#8221; Conti said. &#8220;I disappeared from everywhere and fell into a depression. The seven years of working at WangGuard finally took a toll on me. I had nightmares because of all the macabre deaths I had seen, an obsession with protecting my children from pederasty, OCD, depression, and many other symptoms. It took me about 6 months to recover (and honestly, I may be deceiving myself, since I do not think I completely recovered my life).&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked Conti if clicking through to the websites was necessary for maintaining the service. He explained that while WangGuard blocked emails, domains, IPs, and ISPs, without his manual curation of visiting the domains and clicking the links, users could get a lot of &#8220;sleepers&#8221; &#8211; registered and active accounts that remain silent until one day with a 0day vulnerability or a bug fix, they attack thousands of websites. The sleepers also wait to perform actions like create millions of sites on thousands of WordPress multisite installations in order to create a lot of bad content/links.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Visiting many domains, I was able to minimize this problem,&#8221; Conti said. &#8220;The way I worked not only fixed the current spam / splog problem, but the wizard and database also fixed any future problems with sleepers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another reason he visited the domains was to figure out what he needed to block, whether it was an email or a domain. The domain could be a spam domain or possibly a free email service.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By visiting a website, I could detect whether it was a phishing website or a site camouflaged as an email service in order to try to cheat WangGuard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I saw a lot of &#8216;techniques&#8217; for trying to cheat WangGuard at Black Hat specialized forums. I had been subscribed to many spam/sploggers forums for investigation. Every time that a user described a real technique for cheating WangGuard, it was fixed immediately.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still using the WangGuard plugin, it may continue to work but not nearly as well as in the past. Conti said that some parts of the code work without the API, but the most important parts require the WangGuard/SplogHunter server. The plugin is open source, so anyone can fork it. <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-wangguard-was-closed/" target="_blank">An English translation of his original post</a> is available on the WordPress.org plugin forums.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 00:36:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: WordSesh Asia Now in Planning for 2018, WordCamp Asia Targeted for 2019";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72742";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-asia-now-in-planning-for-2018-wordcamp-asia-targeted-for-2019";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4161:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/wordcamp-asia-meeting-group.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://sakinshrestha.com/events/wordcamp-asia/">Sakin Shrestha</a>\n<p>Yesterday Sakin Shrestha <a href="https://sakinshrestha.com/events/wordcamp-asia/" target="_blank">announced</a> that WordCamp Asia is now in the preliminary planning stages. Shrestha is a key reviewer on the Theme Review Team, translates WordPress to Nepali, and organizes meetups and WordCamps in Nepal. He and other members of the WordPress community in Asia, including representatives from India, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Nepal, had the opportunity to meet at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have been talking about WordCamp Asia informally when some of us attended WordCamp US for the first time,&#8221; Shrestha said. &#8220;That’s was in 2015, where I met Naoko Takano. She is the one with the main idea as the Japanese WordPress community was already doing well. Then we started meeting more people from Asia at WordCamp Europe 2016 and had an informal meeting there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After this meeting, Rahul Bansal created a Facebook group for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/wpasia/" target="_blank">WordPress Community Organizers in Asia</a> to support each other in a more coordinated effort. The first formal meeting happened at WordCamp Europe 2017 where the team decided that trying for WordCamp Asia in 2018 would be too soon. Instead, they are planning to host a WordSesh Asia event in 2018 to work on their coordination and teamwork. The team is working towards hosting WordCamp Asia in 2019.</p>\n<h3>Organizers Consider Bangkok as a Possible Location for WordCamp Asia in 2019</h3>\n<p>Shrestha&#8217;s <a href="https://sakinshrestha.com/events/wordcamp-asia/" target="_blank">post</a> identifies several challenges that are unique to hosting a large scale WordCamp in Asia, including the need for visas even for travel within Asia, political instability, and numerous currencies and languages in use.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp Asia is really important for the WordPress community in Asia,&#8221; Shrestha said. &#8220;I am fortunate enough to attend WCUS and WCEU, which are some of the biggest WordCamps where we get to meet lot of WordPressers, share and exchange ideas, contribute to WordPress, start a new business, and think outside of the box. But for most of Asians, it’s really difficult to go that far and also it’s expensive to attain those. So, we are limited to WordCamps in our own country and neighboring ones. That is why we are thinking about WordCamp Asia in Bangkok, which will be really inclusive as it’s in the center part of Asia and it’s cheaper to go there and less time consuming for all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Shrestha also feels strongly about providing travel assistance for those with financial hardships, as the most expensive aspect of attending a WordCamp is usually the travel and accommodation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamps are not just for the rich,&#8221; Shrestha said. &#8220;The primary motive of WordCamps is to grow the local community. So, WordCamp Asia’s mission will be to influence the community of WordPress Asia and help it to grow. That is why, instead of planning for a grand and pompous event, we need to make sure it is affordable and reachable to people of all financial backgrounds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Shrestha said he has seen major changes in working with the WordPress community in Nepal from 2012 &#8211; 2017, which he attributes to having a stronger local presence with the WordCamp. India has also benefited from hosting WordCamps and has approximately nine happening in various cities. They are working towards hosting a WordCamp India in the future. There are also emerging communities in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s time for pursuing WordCamp Asia,&#8221; Shrestha said. &#8220;We really have good talents here in Asia but we lack exposure. WordCamp Asia can create buzz and make more people aware, inspire, and provide opportunity.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 18:10:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WPTavern: Jesse Petersen, Founder of Genesis The.me Passes Away";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72772";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"https://wptavern.com/jesse-petersen-founder-of-genesis-the-me-passes-away";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8085:"<img />Petersen Family\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jpetersen">Jesse Petersen</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.genesisthe.me/">Genesis The.me</a> and <a href="https://www.petersenmediagroup.com/">Petersen Media Group</a>, has <a href="https://www.newlungsfor.me/2017/jesse-petersen-has-passed-away/">passed away</a> at the age of 38.

The call for the perfect lungs for me will come in God’s timing. I am content to wait.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On July 2nd, a patient with a higher LAS score than Petersen&#8217;s was taken into surgery to receive a double-lung transplant. This made Petersen the highest priority pending a match was found but a match wasn&#8217;t found in time.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">She was taken into surgery at noon, Tampa time. Surgery is 6-12 hours.

From those who knew him personally, Petersen was a great husband, father, and a caring individual who despite his medical situation, would help out the best way he could. There are two stories that highlight the kind of person he was. The first is <a href="https://twitter.com/jpetersen/status/881974173085691904">a Twitter thread</a> he published two days ago.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you meet a 5 year-old who needs a heart and double-lung transplant but has been turned down everywhere, your situation doesn’t seem so bad. That family doesn’t care about politics, social class, keeping up with the Joneses, or whether their clothes match. They are enjoying life.</p>\n<p>Because when it comes down to it, all we really need is to know our worth and love everyone else because they have equal worth. That doesn’t mean you have to agree with everyone, but you don’t have to seek out opposition or turmoil. Random acts of kindness rock.</p>\n<p>Can you look over your life and say you’d be leaving those connected to you better off having known you? If not, start today.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The second is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jesse.dubyah/posts/238778876639367">from his Facebook account</a> about an encounter he had with a mother pushing her small boy in a wheelchair with a surgical mask on.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I finally got out of the house to go do a God &amp; Country service followed by fireworks. While waiting to go outside, a mom I&#8217;d seen pushing a small boy in a wheelchair with a surgical mask and oxygen on him came over to me.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I just wanted to say how cool I think your double tank cart is. I&#8217;m going to call my supplier tomorrow to get one for our wheelchair.&#8217;</p>\n<p>We started talking (most unlike me) and she said her son needed a heart and a double lung transplant&#8230; but they&#8217;ve been turned down everywhere, starting with the very forgiving Pittsburgh center.</p>\n<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8217;</p>\n<p>[nodded her head with a pained look] &#8216;We&#8217;re just making the most of our time now.&#8217;</p>\n<p>My heart broke. I&#8217;ve already lived 7 of his lifetimes. I&#8217;ve played sports, graduated from college, stood on the equator, married my best friend, and have two healthy boys.</p>\n<p>So kick me the next time I complain about my wait, OK?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Members of the WordPress community are using social media to share memories, grieve, and pass along condolences to his family.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I first met <a href="https://twitter.com/jpetersen">@jpetersen</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcorl?src=hash">#wcorl</a> and was honored to have him at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcmia?src=hash">#wcmia</a> 2015.

Eghbal works in community programs at GitHub to better support people doing open source work. Rogers is the community manager at the Node.js Foundation. The episode focuses on the human aspect of the world of open source software and what inspires people to work together to give software away for free.</p>\n<p>Through Eghbal&#8217;s research on sustaining open source communities, she found, as Rogers succinctly summarized on the show: &#8220;There&#8217;s no connection between the number of users and the number of people maintaining a project.&#8221; The <a href="http://heartbleed.com/" target="_blank">Heartbleed Bug</a>, which arrested public attention when it was disclosed in 2014, is perhaps one of the most critical examples of an open source project with a global user base and a grossly disproportionate number of maintainers.</p>\n<p>As part of her research at GitHub, Eghbal is working on creating a vocabulary to explain things that are happening with open source projects. One example is the distinction between &#8220;popular&#8221; versus &#8220;healthy&#8221; when describing projects in terms of the communities behind them, governance, quality of maintainership, and other factors that influence a project&#8217;s condition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because the dialogue tends to be set by popular projects, and those developers and their problems tend to dominate the story about this, you have these words and vocabulary like &#8216;drive-by-contributions,''&#8221; Rogers said. This often implies that maintainers are too busy to look at the code. Rogers advocated for changing this perception of &#8220;drive-by-contributors&#8221; to view them as casual contributors, people who show up and have value to add. If maintainers can seize these contributions as an opportunity, they will have a better chance of leveling up contributors to be a more active part of their organization.</p>\n<p>The group also discussed how technology has caused a cultural shift among open source communities from the old world versus the new world of open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In older open source, part of the barrier to entry that people went through before they were ever identifiable to any contributor was an acclimation to the culture and an acclimation to the tool chain and all this stuff,&#8221; Rogers said. &#8220;One of the things that GitHub has done is completely remove all of that cultural acclimation. There is one tool chain that you use to contribute to any project and when you show up you don&#8217;t have all of this cultural knowledge. You haven&#8217;t bought into any of these ideals about open source necessarily. You&#8217;re just there to contribute. We actually need to work with that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the past, contributors informally acclimated to the culture through the onboarding process, and most software projects were more self-contained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where that becomes awkward today is that so many different pieces of software depend on other open source projects, which wasn&#8217;t actually true 10 or 20 year ago,&#8221; Eghbal said. With so many projects fitting into others as dependencies, it becomes more difficult to actually remove a project from the public domain. Open source licensing ensures that these projects have a life of their own. This has democratized entrepreneurship, making it easy for people to piece together technology to build applications and businesses. It also requires a higher level of skills for people working together across various open source projects and cultures.</p>\n<p>Eghbal and Rogers discussed the qualities of a healthy open source community, such as how welcoming the project is and how contributors speak to each other and resolve conflict. The ability to successfully resolve conflict can make the difference between a healthy growth of contributors or attrition on a project. Rogers mentioned a related conversation they had with Karl Fogel on their <a href="https://changelog.com/rfc" target="_blank">Request for Commits podcast</a> concerning conflict within projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we were talking to Karl, he has this view that &#8216;As long as a it has an open source license, it doesn&#8217;t matter how dysfunctional the project is, because we as a community always have this ability to fork it,''&#8221; Rogers said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t agree with him on this, because the practical reality of forking a project is such a huge overhaul and you don&#8217;t necessarily have the right people to do it in your particular time. What you actually want are the healthy communities with healthy practices, what you want is to keep them going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another open source predicament they discussed, which is fairly common in the WordPress ecosystem, is when a company releases a project as open source or &#8220;gifts it to the community.&#8221; Eghbal likened this to &#8220;sending your dog away to a farm upstate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited to announce this is now open source, meaning we don&#8217;t want to take care of it anymore,&#8221; she said. &#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;ll give it to the community,&#8217; (except they haven&#8217;t actually identified anyone in the community who wants to take care of it.)&#8221; This type of situation shows how &#8220;giving back to the community&#8221; isn&#8217;t always what it appears to be for those who end up using these projects that have been released into the wild.</p>\n<p>The group also discussed how the incentives for people to contribute to open source have changed over the years and why &#8220;the GitHub generation&#8221; has more readily adopted the MIT license.

I was born in Sardinia, an island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, and as a child I dreamt about becoming an air hostess.</p>\n<p>I wanted to travel the world and speak tons of foreign languages, to be able to communicate with local people everywhere I’d go.</p>\n<p>But people kept telling me that I wasn’t going to become tall enough for that job (genetics don’t lie!), and I eventually listened to them. I ended up choosing a different path in life, following the Italian mantra: “You have to study something that will guarantee a stable and secure job for life”.</p>\n<p>Even if I wasn’t that much convinced about the perspective of having the same job for all my life, as my parents did, at the same time I didn’t want to get stuck in the island forever: the unemployment rate in Sardinia is unfortunately really high and I didn’t want to risk to be part of that percentage.</p>\n<h3>Crossing the borders of the island</h3>\n<p>So I chose the Faculty of Economics and did my best to cross the borders of my island as soon as I had the chance: this happened when I was 22 and I moved to Siena, Tuscany, to finish my studies. That is also the time when I opened my first personal blog on an Italian platform named Tiscali, which I later migrated to WordPress.com.</p>\n<p><strong>I’ve always loved writing</strong>, and since I was a little girl I used to spend hours in my room writing stories and poems. I was doing the same with the blog but with the advantage of reaching a much larger public, virtually meeting many people and getting inspired by their stories.</p>\n<p>After 2 years in Tuscany I moved to Strasbourg, France. There I learnt French and did several little jobs, but I found my first important one in Milan, the big city shining with job opportunities for everyone —as Italians love to say.</p>\n<p>There I was, fulfilling the dream of many young people of my age (and their families): I was 25, with an average-paid 40 hours/week office job in the marketing department of a big international company, and I was surrounded by ambitious colleagues and a boss constantly asking for extra —and free— working hours per day.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was feeling like a parrot inside a golden cage.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It seemed to me I wasn’t going anywhere. I also gave up blogging because I wasn’t feeling inspired enough to write. People constantly repeated to me that I was super lucky to have a permanent contract and work in a marketing department; in their eyes I was all set for life, so —using some strange equation — I also had to be happy!</p>\n<p>Of course I was luckier than many of my peers, but I kept asking myself if I really wanted to do that life forever.<br />\nDid I really want to keep on working 10 hours per day under the neon lights of an office, annihilate my dreams and live waiting for the free time of the weekend?</p>\n<p>The most vivid memory I have of that period is the overwhelming feeling clenching my throat on Sunday afternoons, when I started to dread the moment of coming back to the office the day after.</p>\n<h3>Facing new challenges</h3>\n<p>So I left and faced the change. At the beginning I gave myself the opportunity to test different office jobs. But the results were always the same: I kept feeling unsatisfied with my life, and I understood I had to respect my little girl’s dream and fly away from my golden cage.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I opted for emigration and moved alone to Barcelona, Spain, in 2012.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My first move was plunging myself into a few months of intense Spanish learning at the University, then I found a job in an international Assisted Reproduction Clinic.</p>\n<p>My job title was “Patient Coordinator” and I was assisting international patients coming to Barcelona for their treatments: I was their translator, interpreter and administrative consultant. Patients were from Italy, France, England, Morocco, Senegal…it was a Babylon of people with so many different backgrounds that I felt really inspired by some of their stories.<br />\nThis inspiration led me to start writing again: <strong>I dusted off my WordPress blog</strong> and filled it up with stories about my new life in Barcelona and some of the women I was meeting at the Clinic. I was feeling stronger and more independent than ever.</p>\n<p>The job at the Clinic lasted for 3 years. Even if it was really inspiring, it was also very stressful. Imagine being a 30-something woman speaking all day long about fertility problems with women struggling to have a baby.</p>\n<p>I realized I was getting too involved and decided to look around to see what I could do next.</p>\n<h3>How can I find a job like this?</h3>\n<p>It was summer 2015 and I was at my desk, in my little tiny apartment in front of Barcelona’s beach. I was writing in my blog and I got stuck in a technical problem. While I was searching through the WordPress.com documentation, I saw a pop-up in the bottom right corner of my screen: an Automattician wrote me to ask if I needed help. I gladly accepted her offer, we chatted for a few minutes, the problem was solved and I could go back to my writing. But I also left the chat with one question: <strong>how could that person on chat find a support job with WordPress</strong>?</p>\n<p>Curious as I am, I started looking for an answer and I stumbled upon the official WordPress job page: <a href="http://jobs.wordpress.net">jobs.wordpress.net</a></p>\n<p>There I found a job offer that caught my attention: WP Media, a French startup, was looking for <strong>a polyglot and remote customer service teammate</strong> for one of their plugins, WP Rocket. I read their requirements: fluency in English, French and possibly another language, great experience with WordPress, some coding skills.</p>\n<p>That offer was calling me, I felt it.</p>\n<p><strong>I knew I didn&#8217;t have all the requirements</strong>, but hey, I could speak 4 languages, and I had a WordPress blog…right? Of course, I didn’t know anything about PHP, I had always been a WordPress.com user until that moment and I didn’t really know how to manage a self-hosted website or use a cache plugin…but I felt I was ready to learn all that. And moreover, what did I have to lose?</p>\n<h3>I wrote my most inspired cover letter and sent my CV.</h3>\n<p>With my total surprise, they answered me the day after and we set up an interview by Skype. My main strengths were the fluency in 4 languages and my previous experience in customer service, so I was really confident about those skills; yet I wanted to be totally honest with them: yes, I had been using WordPress for a long time, and yes, I was digital savvy enough, but I knew very little on the technical side. I had always worked on the front end of websites, writing, blogging, learning by myself; I didn&#8217;t know anything about the backend of WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>Even so, they had faith in me and in a few days I had the confirmation: I was in! <strong>During the first days I felt so happy about this new major turning point in my life</strong>: not only had I found a job thanks to my primordial passion, speaking foreign languages, but for the first time in my life I could do that job from home or anywhere else I liked, instead of being caged in a formal office!</p>\n<p>I got introduced to my remote teammates and I instantly felt welcomed.</p>\n<h3>Learning by doing</h3>\n<p>But, very soon, that initial enthusiasm started to struggle with another intense feeling: <strong>the fear of exposing my inexperience</strong>.</p>\n<p>There were too many things I didn&#8217;t know!</p>\n<p>Working in a WordPress backend was so new to me that I started studying like crazy and reading everything I could about WordPress for beginners. I went through some really intense months of learning by doing, supported by my teammates. Like a baby who start crawling and then taking little steps, I was initially answering the easiest tickets from our customers.  At the same my teammates were sending me useful material to read, setting up video-calls for 1to1 training, encouraging me every time they could.</p>\n<p>After a few days I received the first happy comments by the customers I was helping in their mother tongue: until that moment the plugin’s support had been offered only in English and French, so it was the first time Spanish and Italian customers were being answered in their own language…and they appreciated that!</p>\n<p>Even so, I can’t deny it, I was scared.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was so scary admitting my ignorance, exposing it in a remote environment where I couldn’t see my teammates reactions live.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My first instinct was imagining the worst scenarios where they were secretly hating me for interrupting their work on Slack with my doubts.</p>\n<p>But I had no other choice than to keep asking questions and learn from their answers. Not doing so would have been much worse: silencing my voice would have slowed down my learning process.</p>\n<h3>Why don’t you try to contribute to WordPress?</h3>\n<p>We were at WordCamp Paris 2016 when one of my teammates showed me how the WordPress community worked together and kept in contact through Slack.</p>\n<p>“You speak multiple languages, why don’t you try to contribute to the polyglots team?” —he asked.</p>\n<p>That thought never crossed my mind before, I knew very little about contributing to WordPress. I had been working for WP Media for 6 months and, while I was enjoying my new job a lot, I was just slowly starting to abandon that overwhelming feeling of insecurity I mentioned above.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I didn’t feel ready to dive into a new challenge and start also contributing to WordPress, I thought I didn’t have the ability to do that. I was wrong, obviously.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Curiosity won on me another time and I joined the two Slack channels <em>Making WordPress</em> (where all the WP global community meets) and <em>Italia WP Community</em>. I lurked the channels for a few months, until I went to WordCamp Milan and met some members of the Italian Polyglots team.</p>\n<p>It was love at first string: Laura, one of the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/?locale=it_IT">General Translation Editors</a> (GTE) for Italy, taught me how to start contributing and translating following the polyglots guidelines. She also told me about the big effort the Italian community has been doing to work together, consistently, to boost WordPress related events in Italy and to grow up.</p>\n<p>I wanted to be an active part of it and I started contributing.</p>\n<p><strong>Now I’m a Project Translator Editor for the Italian polyglots team</strong> and I mentor new contributors: I love it!</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of my journey into the WordPress world I traveled a lot, and also attended WordCamps in <a href="https://2016.paris.wordcamp.org/">Paris</a>, <a href="https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/">Vienna</a>, <a href="https://2016.milano.wordcamp.org/">Milan</a>, <a href="https://2016.barcelona.wordcamp.org/">Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://2017.torino.wordcamp.org/">Torino</a> and <a href="https://2017.bilbao.wordcamp.org/">Bilbao</a>.</p>\n<p>Following my teammates encouragement, <strong>I also started applying to WordCamps as a speaker</strong>, because I felt my story could be important for other people looking for new inspiration for their working and personal life. I gave my first talk in my adoptive city, Barcelona, in December 2016, then in Torino in April 2017 and I recently had the honor to tell my story also from the stage of WordCamp Europe 2017.</p>\n<p>In a short glimpse of time I engaged in many activities related to WordPress which allowed me to meet very interesting and inspiring people from all over the world.</p>\n<h3>I’m (not) lucky.</h3>\n<p>People keep telling me that I’m lucky, and it’s true, I really am. But if I’m here, now, sharing my story (and thanks Topher for inviting me to write it!) is not because I live under a lucky star: I just used my previous skills and passions and adapted them to a new career and life path.</p>\n<p>We all have some skills; and if we don’t know which they are exactly, we should take some time to make a list of the things we’re really good at. With that in mind, just try. Apply. Get involved. Don’t get stuck in the feeling of “I can’t do it because I don’t know enough”.</p>\n<p>That is what I did: without even realizing it, I started putting into reality the dream of the little girl who was born in an island and wanted to travel and speak different languages.</p>\n<p>WordPress made this possible: I’m part of a big community, and I am proud of it.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: How I tried, applied, got involved.

Despite being <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/do-not-miss-the-biggest-wordcamp-in-europe/" target="_blank">promoted</a> as &#8220;the largest WordPress event to this day&#8221; with more than 3,000 expected attendees, WCEU 2017 fell short with 1,900 people on the ground. Attendees were 5% fewer than last year&#8217;s 2,000 in Vienna. Expectations ran high but organizers could not predict the 24% no-show rate once the event got started. This is more than double the 10% no-show rate for the previous four years.</p>\n<p>The camp&#8217;s organizers do not have a simple explanation for the high no-show rate, but cite several factors, including a few dozen participants being <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-attendees-are-being-denied-visas-because-conference-ticket-price-is-too-low" target="_blank">denied visas</a>, higher local sales, an expensive location, and putting tickets on sale too early. Approximately 60% of attendees were from nearby countries, such as France, Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>Ticket sales for 2017 were open immediately at the conclusion of the 2016 event in Vienna. Organizers found that tickets sold in the first six months had a 34% no-show rate as compared to 20% for those sold in 2017. As the event has often sold out in the past, prospective attendees may have felt pressure to purchase a ticket in advance without confirming the ability to attend. </p>\n<p>Posting increasingly higher attendance numbers isn&#8217;t one of the goals of the WordCamp, but planning accurately for the number of people who will attend is crucial for resource and budget planning. When one in four attendees is a no-show, the plans for food, swag, venue accommodations, and other aspects of the event are askew.</p>\n<p>Organizers did not mention <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-kicks-off-with-contributor-day-focused-on-growing-wordpress-through-inclusion" target="_blank">Contributor Day</a> attendance in the wrap-up report, but this may have been one of the most successful aspects of the event. It was held prior to the main conference days, which may explain the event&#8217;s unusually high attendance numbers. Organizers hosted 473 attendees for the 500 available contributors slots. </p>\n<h3>WordCamp Europe 2017 Cost 300€ per Attendee, Sponsors Covered 80%</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Europe&#8217;s wrap-up report also includes a transparent breakdown of the event&#8217;s 700k€ budget. Catering costs for lunches, snacks and drinks, made up 50% of the budget. However, organizers were limited to the venue&#8217;s catering partners, which blurs the line between actual food versus venue costs. </p>\n<p>The team was unable to sell all of the sponsorship packages and was forced to reduce the budget by 149k€ along the way. WordCamp Central subsidized 10€/ticket and covered the final deficit of 28k€. The cost breakdown per attendee was 300€ with sponsors covering 80%, WordCamp Central 7%, and tickets sales 13%. These numbers show that the 40€ ticket price is a small fraction of the total costs required for an event of this size. </p>\n<p>Organizers said they felt it was important to share the data for educational purposes but also to &#8220;demonstrate to everyone who might have a doubt, that maintaining the ticket fee very low is meant to make our events accessible to all, but that the fee is not an indicator of the value of the conference.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 19:06:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: June 2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4865";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9049:"<p><i>We&#8217;re starting a new regular feature on this blog today.

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

Blocks can currently be sorted with up and down arrows located to the left of the content but the beta only allows for single-column stacking.</p>\n<p>One of the goals for Gutenberg is to provide &#8220;a page building experience that makes it easy to create rich post layouts.&#8221; As far as layout building goes, the first planned versions of the new editor are very primitive as compared to Wix and Weebly&#8217;s drag and drop website builders where nearly every element on the page can be easily moved to a different position.</p>\n<p>Contributors have been discussing the intricacies of adding this feature to Gutenberg since February. James Nylen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38#issuecomment-309984280" target="_blank">summarized some of the challenges</a> that make drag and drop more complicated to implement: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Dragging and dropping a block is not really a one-step operation. It is more like 3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press and hold mouse button or screen</li>\n<li>Move to desired location</li>\n<li>Release</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 2 is incredibly difficult to get right, and requires a lot of complicated behaviors like duplicating an item (or at least its general shape and size), scroll handling, and determining the intended new location, especially at the beginning and end of the content. We have all used bad drag-and-drop experiences, and I would argue they are worse than not having it at all.</p>\n<p>That said, for two-dimensional movement with columns, I agree that arrows alone are probably not a good solution. Though mobile support for that is going to be very tricky no matter how it works.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several commenters on the ticket agree that repeatedly clicking arrows to move blocks is cumbersome and will become untenable in the future when multi-column support is added. This would require up, down, right, and left arrows to rearrange content. Users have come to expect a drag-and-drop interface, because nearly every page builder application offers it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are thinking of drag and drop as a progressive enhancement for desktops,&#8221; Joen Asmussen said. &#8220;One that would be great to have, but we should build it after we have explicit button actions in place for doing the same, including splitting into columns in the future. This decision is based on a desire to ensure accessibility as well as mobile devices can play the same game.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asmussen marked the ticket priority as low in May and removed it from the beta milestone. At this point, users are not likely to see drag and drop in the first release that ships with WordPress core. </p>\n<h3>Multi-Column Layouts Planned for Gutenberg V2</h3>\n<p>The discussion surrounding adding drag-and-drop to the editor naturally leads into <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/219" target="_blank">adding multi-column support</a>. Limiting users to a single column is a one-dimensional approach to designing pages, but contributors don&#8217;t plan to leave Gutenberg without multi-column support for long. </p>\n<p>Geoarge Olaru, a designer at <a href="https://pixelgrade.com/" target="_blank">PixelGrade</a>, shared a <a href="https://invis.io/3FAS8VQE8#/222711568_Creating_Columns_-_0" target="_blank">prototype</a> for adding a simple two or three-grid column layout to Gutenberg. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Extending WordPress further from the default Blog Posts automatically implies the need of multi-column layouts for presentation pages,&#8221; Olaru said. &#8220;I would prefer to tackle this feature upfront, rather than letting every developer do it on his own (see the multitude of page builders plugins).&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/multi-column-mockup.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;For the V1 editor, I&#8217;m afraid columns like this is out of scope,&#8221; Asmussen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/219#issuecomment-285330922" target="_blank">said</a> in reply to a Olaru&#8217;s ticket with mockups and a prototype for multi-column support. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a &#8216;no&#8217; — rather, we need some technical foundations to be solid first, before we commit to the really interesting stuff. But it might be a V1.1, or at the very least something for the customization folks later on in the year. Even before that, it would be good to keep this UI in mind, so that perhaps a plugin can add this even earlier.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Other commenters on the ticket feel more urgency about getting multi-column support into the first version of the editor. One of the concerns is that plugin developers will rush to add columns immediately based on demands from users, who will then have to migrate once core adds support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Multi column layouts are a must-have,&#8221; Anthony Hortin commented on the ticket. &#8220;At the moment, Gutenberg isn&#8217;t solving any issue. You still end up with one long column of content. The whole reason page builders are so popular, and why hundreds of thousands of people are using them, is because they provide the ability to easily make multi-column layouts. Without this functionality, you&#8217;re not providing any reason to use Gutenberg over a page builder plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the main challenges of adding multi-column support is figuring out what type of grid system to use and making sure that it scales from mobile to desktop. Weston Ruter joined the discussion to say that the foundational work for nested block support is being done now in version 1, but the UI for displaying them hasn&#8217;t been implemented yet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I appreciate the excitement and urgency to wanting columns,&#8221; Asmussen said. &#8220;We feel the same urgency. It&#8217;s not about not wanting columns, it&#8217;s purely about managing resources at this point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The good news is if you&#8217;ve been testing Gutenberg and wondering where some of these features are on the roadmap, they will be coming in later versions. While there may be disagreements about how much of a priority drag-and-drop and multi-column support should have for version 1, contributors agree that laying a solid technical foundation for these features is crucial for future extensibility.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 01 Jul 2017 19:06:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:116:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.3.0 Adds Front-End Styles for Core Blocks, Notices Framework, and Text and Image Quick Inserts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=72646";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:125:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-3-0-adds-front-end-styles-for-core-blocks-notices-framework-and-text-and-image-quick-inserts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4557:"<p>Gutenberg development is marching ahead with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/whats-new-in-gutenberg-june-30/" target="_blank">version 0.3.0</a> released today.

Gutenberg now displays <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1564" target="_blank">notices on post save, schedule, and update</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gutenberg-notices.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 0.3.0 adds a new <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1555" target="_blank">block descriptions component</a> to blocks with inspector controls. Several of the core blocks now display descriptions. These will be especially useful when plugin developers begin adding their own custom blocks, offering users a quick way to see the purpose of the block.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/block-description-e1498855903121.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release adds more placeholder text to various blocks, as &#8220;placeholders are key,&#8221; according to the newly added <a href="http://gutenberg-devdoc.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Gutenberg&selectedStory=Design&full=0&down=1&left=1&panelRight=1&downPanel=storybooks%2Fstorybook-addon-knobs" target="_blank">design blueprints and principles</a> included in Gutenberg&#8217;s documentation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If your block can have a neutral placeholder state, it should. An image placeholder block shows a button to open the media library, a text placeholder block shows a writing prompt. By embracing placeholders we can predefine editable layouts, so all you have to do is fill out the blanks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Version 0.3.0 also adds several enhancements that make it easier to edit and customize the image-oriented blocks with more options and settings: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added “edit image” button to image and cover image blocks</li>\n<li>Added option to visually crop images in galleries for nicer alignment</li>\n<li>Added option to disable dimming the background in cover images</li>\n<li>Added option to display date and to configure number of posts in LatestPosts block</li>\n<li>Added text formatting to CoverImage block</li>\n<li>Added toggle option for fixed background in CoverImage</li>\n<li>Added placeholder for all text blocks</li>\n<li>Added placeholder text for headings, quotes, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Active installs for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank">Gutenberg plugin</a> have nearly doubled since last week and are at more than 900 sites. This is roughly 1% of the goal Matt Mullenweg set for testing on 100,000 sites before replacing the edit screen. The plugin may also be advertised in the dashboard in a future release, possibly 4.8.1, which is slated for the end of July.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 22:07:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Popular WordPress Plugins Slow to Add Meta Box Support for Calypso";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71527";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"https://wptavern.com/popular-wordpress-plugins-slow-to-add-meta-box-support-for-calypso";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3361:"<p>During the State of the Word at WordCamp US 2016, Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">announced</a> that Calypso was <a href="https://youtu.be/Nl6U7UotA-M?t=37m1s">plugin aware</a>. Calypso is a REST API and React <a href="https://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress">powered application</a> for the desktop created by Automattic <a href="https://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/">in 2015</a>.</p>\n<p>Developers with plugins active on 1M sites or more <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/10517">received an email invitation</a> from Andy Peatling to begin building support for Calypso.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Calypso is now plugin-aware,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;This pull request was merged today, and as a way to bootstrap this, we’re opening up for what I just described for plugins to create Calypso interfaces for what they’re doing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically saying, if you’re using Calypso on a site that has one of these plugins, let’s say WooCommerce, all of a sudden in the interface, there will be all the WooCommerce stuff. It’ll talk to the API, it will run on the desktop just like the rest of Calypso, and it will only be loaded if the plugin is active.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the major differences between <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">Calypso</a> and WP-Admin is that custom meta boxes added by plugins are not accessible in Calypso.</p>\n<p>Nearly seven months since the announcement, popular WordPress plugins have struggled to add meta box support, including those maintained by Automattic. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO</a>, active on more than 3M sites, is among the plugins that were selected to take part in the experiment.</p>\n<p>When asked about the progress of making WordPress SEO Calypso aware, Joost de Valk, founder of <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast.com</a>, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Automattic has seen little progress on the initiative, &#8220;No news to report at this time, but hope to have some soon,&#8221; Automattic representative Mark Armstrong said. WooCommerce has yet to add meta box support and settings pages in Calypso.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg, WordPress&#8217; new editor, is also built using React. One of the chief concerns expressed by users and developers is how it will <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952">support custom meta boxes</a> built using the current PHP framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I miss a lot of the meta boxes I’m used to seeing on the screen,&#8221; <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin said</a>. &#8220;Things like Yoast SEO (on some sites) and custom taxonomies are just not shown. If every meta box ever made for WordPress needs to be remade, it sure is going to make developers lives a living hell.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I want to use Calypso as a replacement for WP-Admin because it&#8217;s fast and I like the interface.

There are currently two local camps on the schedule and a few others in the pre-planning stage.

Although it is just a minor update, the release was a large undertaking with 1,600 commits from 84 contributors. </p>\n<p>The most exciting feature in 3.1 is the new built-in product importer/exporter that supports CSV files, a feature previously offered through extensions. The importer makes it easier to migrate stores from other e-commerce platforms, as well as add and update product information for existing stores. Users can select whether to update existing products or create new products and can map the data against product fields:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/woo-product-importer.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The tool is also useful for those selling across multiple storefronts or marketplaces and is capable of matching up data based on product ID or SKU. Please note that it only handles products and not customers and orders. Store owners looking to import those additional items will still need to use an extension.</p>\n<p>Version 3.1 also introduces the ability to manage WooCommerce.com extension licenses within WooCommerce core, eliminating the need to install the helper extension and copy subscription keys over. Customers can now connect their WooCommerce.com account to the site and download, manage, and activate extensions in the admin. Developers or agencies that have purchased extensions on behalf of clients will need to contact WooCommerce to transfer the subscriptions to a new owner in order for them to show up within the clients&#8217; admin. </p>\n<p>This release also includes several other improvements, including the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add oEmbeds to the product short description, more useful error messages</li>\n<li>More useful error messages</li>\n<li>Add oEmbeds to the product short description</li>\n<li>Customers can accept ‘Terms and conditions’ without leaving checkout</li>\n<li>Set stock statuses for variations in bulk from the edit product screen</li>\n<li>Small improvements to the setup wizard</li>\n<li>WooCommerce Services Plugin: Add live shipping rates for USPS and Canada Post and print discounted shipping labels for USPS without leaving the store</li>\n<li>New search helpers for orders to allow developers to query orders by multiple props</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many WooCommerce store owners experienced considerable difficulties in updating to 3.0 due to extension incompatibilities. This is one of the reasons why WooCommerce recommends making backups of your store and testing the 3.1 update on a staging site to see how it affects themes and extensions. The changes in 3.1 should be backwards compatible with 3.0.x sites, but impact on extensions needs to be tested before pushing the update live.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 00:30:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 12:30:52 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 12:15:10 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130911040210";}', 'no');

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure â and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and youâre ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8BDWH3QG-1-video" width="632" height="342" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. Youâll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world?

These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

WordPress 4.8Â is named afterÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans">William John &#8220;Bill&#8221; Evans</a>, an American jazz pianist.</p>\n<h2>New Image, Video, and Audio Widgets</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 includes <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">three new widgets</a>.Â All three widgets make it easier to display images, video, or audioÂ  without using HTML. The Text widget now has support for TinyMCE providing rich-text functionality. Similar to the post editor, users have a choice between using a Visual or Text editor with limited formatting options.</p>\n<img />Image, Video, and Enhanced TextÂ Widget\n<p>Because the Text widget uses TinyMCE, it inherits its nuances when it comes to pasting and displaying code. In aÂ <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">dev note</a>Â that explains how TinyMCE was added to the TextÂ Widget, Weston Ruter offersÂ the following notice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When pasting HTML into the &#8216;Text&#8217; (HTML) tab of the Text widget, any extraneous line breaks should be removed or else unwanted paragraphs and line beaks may result. This is particularly important when you paste in <code>script</code> or <code>style</code> tags (as in the case of 3rd-party JavaScript embeds), since auto-inserted paragraphs will cause script errors; this will be fixed in <span class="p2_hovercardify"><a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2833">#2833</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This behavior aligns with longstanding behavior in the post editor, so it is not new, although it does differ from how the Text widget has previously behaved. As noted above, for previously existing Text widgets that had the auto-add paragraphs&#8217; checkbox unchecked (and thus the <code>filter</code> instance prop set to <code>false</code>), the previous behavior of not doing <code>wpautop</code> will be maintained: only once the widgets are modified will any extraneous line breaks need to be removed.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Link Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Adding and editing links in the visual editor is more intuitive thanks to link boundaries. Link boundaries provide a visual representation of where a link begins and ends. This helps prevent adding unnecessary text to the beginning or end of a link.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>See Nearby WordPress Events in the Dashboard</h2>\n<p>One of the pillars of WordPress&#8217; ecosystem is its community of meetups and WordCamps. <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">In 2016</a>, more than 62,566 people attended a local meetup in 58 countries. AboutÂ aÂ third of those were new members.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 draws attention to these events by <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/03/23/showing-upcoming-local-events-in-wp-admin/">enhancing the News Dashboard widget</a>. The widget will try to automatically guess your location and display meetups and WordCamps that are nearby.</p>\n<img />News Widget Shows Upcoming Meetups and WordCamps\n<p>If the location is incorrect, clicking the Pencil button opens a box where you can type in your city.

In WordPress 4.8, the <a href="https://wptavern.com/-increases-maximum-width-of-the-customizer-sidebar-to-600-pixels">Customizer Sidebar is responsive</a> and its width will automatically increase based on the size of the screen up to a maximum of 600 pixels.</p>\n<img />Customizer Sidebar 345 Pixels Wide\n<h2>More Accessible Admin Pages</h2>\n<p>The headers on admin screens are now <a href="https://wptavern.com/-improves-accessibility-on-admin-screens">separate elements</a> making it easier for assistive technologies to help people navigate pages.</p>\n<h2>Support Dropped for Internet Explorer Versions 8, 9, and 10</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/23/target-browser-coverage/">drops support</a> for Internet Explorer versions 8, 9, and 10 asÂ these versions no longer receive security updatesÂ and are used by a small percentage of people.

The <a href="https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/" target="_blank">WCEU Paris Guide app</a> includes location and transportation information, schedules for the event, suggestions on where to eat (restaurants, bistros, a selection of the best cheap eats), a list of top attractions and museums, and nightlife recommendations.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wceu-paris-guide.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Worona has released an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.worona.paris.app" target="_blank">Android app</a> and an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1238819389&mt=8" target="_blank">iOS app</a> for attendees to download. Currently the app needs to be connected to the internet, but the company is working on supporting an offline mode in the next version, which is rolling out soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We used our online platform to turn a WordPress blog (<a href="https://paris.worona.org" target="_blank">paris.worona.org</a>) into a native app,&#8221; Reyes MartÃ­nez, Worona&#8217;s marketing and communications specialist, said. &#8220;We use React and fetch the content using the WP-API. The apps are created with <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is a relatively new WordPress startup in Europe, having released its first prototype in late 2014. The company offers its mobile app building platform to users for free via its <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/worona/" target="_blank">plugin on WordPress.org</a>. The platform turns WordPress sites into native mobile apps that users can publish to the app stores. Worona can also manage the process of publishing the app for a one-time 290â¬ fee.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Worona had more than 12,000 users from 150 different countries. After launching its new platform four months ago, more than 11,500 users have signed up.</p>\n<p>MartÃ­nez said that Worona differs from existing WordPress app builders in that it is free, user-friendly, completely open source, and extensible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We studied the WordPress ecosystem and the mobile distribution trends during the last three years and realized that other existing solutions, such as AppPresser, are just focused on one or two mobile channels, but not in all of them,&#8221; MartÃ­nez said. &#8220;This can be a problem for publishers, as they have to configure the different channels (apps, web apps, AMP, Facebook Instant Articles) one by one and take care of being consistent with all of them. After launching our own beta in 2015 and testing similar solutions, we decided to develop an all-in-one platform with the vision of becoming the leading solution for mobile distribution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is also aiming to create an ecosystem of extensions and themes for the platform, allowing third-party developers to create new solutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The strategy of creating a marketplace of extensions has been successfully accomplished by the WordPress ecosystem before (but not by any of our direct competitors),&#8221; MartÃ­nez said. &#8220;WooCommerce, for example, gives you access to a variety of extensions aiming to solve any problems related to your e-commerce. Because it is open-source, these features can be created by any developer or user. The bigger the community, the higher the range of solutions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Worona is currently a team of five, including two co-founders, a marketing specialist, and two full-stack developers. Most of the team will be at WordCamp Europe. They hope the <a href="https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/" target="_blank">WCEU Paris Guide app</a> will be useful for attendees and also provide a good introduction to their product. If you have any feedback that would make the app more useful, make sure to <a href="https://blog.worona.org/wceu-paris-guide/" target="_blank">comment on the announcement</a> and Worona may be able to incorporate user suggestions before the event.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:32:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.8 âEvansâ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31595:"<h2>An Update with You in Mind</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4816" src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/release-featured-image.png?resize=632%2C316&ssl=1" alt="" /></p>\n<h3>Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!</h3>\n<p>Version 4.8 of WordPress, named &#8220;Evans&#8221; in honor of jazz pianist and composer William John &#8220;Bill&#8221; Evans,Â is available for download or update in your WordPress dashboard.Â New features in 4.8Â add more ways for you to express yourself and represent your brand.</p>\n<p>Though some updates seem minor, theyâve been built by hundreds of contributors with <em>you</em> in mind. Get ready for new features youâll welcome like an old friend: link improvements, <em>three</em> new media widgets covering images, audio, and video, an updated text widget that supports visual editing, and an upgraded news section in your dashboard which brings in nearby and upcoming WordPress events.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Exciting Widget Updates</h2>\n<p><img class="size-large wp-image-4776 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/widgets-with-all-four.png?resize=632%2C436&ssl=1" alt="" /></p>\n<h3>Image Widget</h3>\n<p>Adding an image to a widget is now a simple task that is achievable for any WordPress user without needing to know code. Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure â and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and youâre ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. Youâll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&ssl=1" alt="" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world? WordPress now draws your attention to the events that help you continue improving your WordPress skills, meet friends, and, of course, publish!</p>\n<p>This is quickly becoming one of our favorite features. While you are in the dashboard (because youâre running updates and writing posts, right?) all upcoming WordCamps and official WordPress Meetups â local to you â will be displayed.</p>\n<p>Being part of the community can help you improve your WordPress skills and network with people you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise meet. Now you can easily find your local events just by logging in to your dashboard and looking at the new Events and News dashboard widget.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Even More Developer HappinessÂ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="?" class="wp-smiley" /></h2>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/">More Accessible Admin Panel Headings</a></h3>\n<p>New CSS rules mean extraneous content (like âAdd Newâ links) no longer need to be included in admin-area headings. These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

The plugin offers a lightweight, elegant popup message for capturing email addresses, displaying a (fake) live chat, or announcing a sale or event.</p>\n<p>Bolinger designed it to be non-intrusive &#8211; it&#8217;s not the kind of modal dialog that obscures content with an animated box in the middle of the page. Holler Box appears at the bottom right-hand of the page by default.</p>\n<p>After finding other WordPress popup plugins to be too complex for his needs, Bolinger decided to create his own solution for displaying a quick notification on his websites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Iâm a developer, and even adding a simple banner or popup to my site is not easy,&#8221; Bolinger said. I have to write the code, test locally, push to staging, test there, then push to production and do a final test. When I want to remove the message, I have to reverse the process. Iâm busy, and that takes time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bolinger made it so that creating a new Holler Box is as easy as writing a new blog post. The content editing screen includes a meta box with options for customizing the display.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/holler-box-meta-box.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The &#8220;Advanced Settings&#8221; meta box allows users to set pages where the notification should be displayed, limit to logged-in only or logged-out visitors, set the display for new or returning visitors, and customize the delay based on time or scrolling. It also gives options for when the Holler Box should disappear and how often it should be shown to each visitor.</p>\n<p>Holler Box is capable of a wide range of uses. A few examples include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>(Fake) Live Chat with Opt-in</strong>\n<p>Show a live chat box to collect customer questions and emails, without having to actually deal with the hassle of live chat.

It&#8217;s stable and usable and runs on this site but we would love more people to test it out before we release a new version.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s just some of the new features and bug fixes we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The plugin was based on WP-Cache which stored cache files in a single directory, and those (legacy caching) files were for the most part stored the same way all this time but now they&#8217;re being placed in the supercache directories (<a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/177">#177</a>). This makes it easier to manage these files. The plugin doesn&#8217;t have to search through potentially hundreds of cache files for those that need to be deleted if a page updates or someone leaves a comment. Now all those files will be in the same directory structure the anonymous &#8220;supercache&#8221; files will be. I&#8217;m really excited about this feature as it makes caching for logged in users/users who comment and caching of pages with parameters so much faster now.</li>\n<li> We&#8217;re adding a <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">REST API</a> to the plugin because in the future not everyone is going to use wp-admin to take care of their sites. Take a look in the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/tree/master/rest">rest directory</a> for the code we&#8217;re working on.</li>\n<li> Debug logs now have a username and password to protect them from prying eyes.</li>\n<li> And many <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">bugs fixed</a> over the last few months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since &#8220;legacy caching&#8221; or &#8220;WP-Cache caching&#8221; is now more maintainable and faster we <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/issues/224">want to change the language</a> describing how the plugin caches and delivers pages. </p>\n<p><a href="https://odd.blog/files/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-07-at-17.35.25.png"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Currently the plugin asks you to choose between mod_rewrite, PHP and &#8220;Legacy page caching&#8221; which isn&#8217;t really useful. Most users won&#8217;t recognise those terms. It&#8217;s also not accurate as &#8220;legacy page caching&#8221; is active all the time as long as caching is enabled.<br />\nInstead we should have &#8220;Standard Caching&#8221; and &#8220;Super Caching&#8221;. Super Caching will then have simple and expert delivery methods.</p>\n<p>Simple delivery is through PHP, while expert delivery uses mod_rewrite rules which means the .htaccess file has to be updated and hopefully the warning below it will discourage casual users from testing it.</p>\n<p>Due to the huge number of changes in the plugin we really need people to give it a try and check if everything works ok. The <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/255">changes to the settings page</a> will hopefully make it easier for new users to get to grips with it too.</p>\n<p>You can find the newest code <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache">on Github</a>. The changes to the settings page are in <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache/pull/255">#255</a> if you want to comment on them. </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance! ?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href="https://odd.blog/2011/10/19/preload-categories-and-custom-post-content/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Preload categories and custom post content">Preload categories and custom post content</a></li><li> <a href="https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href="https://odd.blog/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href="https://odd.blog/" rel="external nofollow">Source</a></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 07 Jun 2017 17:24:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Donncha";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"HeroPress: Trust The Dots";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1890";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://heropress.com/essays/trust-the-dots/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=trust-the-dots";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12678:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/060717-min-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: WordPress is such an amazing melting pot that involves people from everywhere, no matter how old they are, where they are from, or what languages they speak." /><p>I was born twice: first, as a baby boy in the sunny morning of Monday June 14, 1993 in Taiz, Yemen; and then again, in the fall of 2008. It was my first time to study at a public high school, grade 10, class 12. It was completely different than the private school I used to study at. It was big and crowded, with a minimum of 80 students in each class!</p>\n<p>At that time, I was trying to improve my personality and explore new opportunities. I wanted to live my life fully, not as the teenager that I was. A way to organize my thoughts and connect with new people was needed. I did not have a clue what to do until the moment I got the chance to use the internet and began to read online blogs of many interesting bloggers. The idea of blogging was fascinating to me. âWhy not starting one?â I thought to myself.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>As days passed, I met four enthusiastic and ambitious schoolmates who became my friends till now. Â Mohammed, one of them, was a relatively quiet and open minded person. My mates and I got to know him through MSN Messenger, and, surprisingly, he was studying in the next class! He was very absorbed in Web Development and was working on a custom CMS platform and some other web applications for his fatherâs clinic. I asked him about blogging software he would recommend. He strongly recommended Joomla and also suggested Drupal, WordPress and others. I tried them all.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress was so easy to use and out-of-the-box, although I had failed a few times while I was trying to install it locally. Once I had logged-in to the dashboard, honestly, I thrilled to pieces!</p></blockquote>\n<p>After some time, my friends and I decided to start a simple blog about Graphics Design using WordPress. It was my beginning to learn the basics of Web Development (HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP). Fortunately, Mohammed had a book that he lent me, and some PDFs, that I copied. We were constantly discussing and learning from each other during break times or in the afternoons. They were enjoyable and enlightening moments.</p>\n<p>I used to receive some positive messages as the developer of the blog we started and appreciative replies to my answers for some questions in <a href="http://ar-wp.com">Arab WordPress</a> community, a forum to share knowledge among Arab WordPress users. This encouraged me to start a small freelancing business with WordPress. It seemed a great idea to expand expertise, earn some money, and follow my passion!</p>\n<h3>Fitting It All In</h3>\n<p>Being a freelancer and a high-school student at the same time was not that easy as one would think! Sometimes I was working until 3:00 a.m. to finish a client project, and then woke up at 6:30 a.m. rushing to school. Most often, classes were so dry that led me to write PHP codes in every copy-book of mine! If you would like to try this at your school, remember to move yourself to the end of your class or be ready for any of your teachersâ mean reactions to keep you attentive! On several afternoons, I used to take naps to restore my energy and be ready to work at night.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Very rarely, I would have to stay out at internet cafÃ©s until 2:00 a.m. to upload/download things I needed because we had no Internet connection at home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For sure, this made my parents quite angry and obviously worried. Most importantly, I had neither a cell phone because of some strict rules in my family nor a national ID card because of the legal age requirement in Yemen. I was attempting to use my school ID card to receive money transactions, and guess what? I was lucky enough to manage it twice. But then I was asked to present a national ID. â When will I turn 18?â I just had to overcome that obstacle, asking trustworthy friends to help.</p>\n<p>My clients were mostly from the Arab World, Europe, and USA. I had the chance to contact with many nice and outstanding people who not only boosted my experience but also showed me the way into some new opportunities and more success.</p>\n<h3>Support At Home</h3>\n<p>At the beginning, most of my family members thought I was playing, except my MOTHER. I remember the moment I told her about my fairly new business. She said, &#8220;Regardless of what it is, just do what you love and believe in!&#8221; However, I faced hard times trying to convince her I did not smoke as she smelled cigarette on my clothes whenever I got back home from those cafÃ©s! On the other hand, my father was the kind of man who stood backstage. He used to tell his friends how happy and proud he was of me. That was all what I needed from him.</p>\n<h3>Giving Back</h3>\n<p>On August 2012, I sent a message to Rasheed Bydousi, Arab WordPress community founder and translation editor of Arabic language, to suggest some ideas and ask to be a volunteer. He was very supportive and truly wise. We started discussing and working on some ideas for more than <a href="http://www.ar-wp.com/forums/topic/2119/">4 months</a>. In parallel with studying, working, and being a volunteer, I increased my efforts in translating, patching (helping in development), and reporting bugs for WordPress projects.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was very important for me to give back to the community I had taken a lot from.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I felt the need of holding a WordPress meeting in my hometown, Taiz, because of the lack of specialized people who would like to collaborate and share knowledge. In 2013, I invited local developers to a small meeting in a local coffeeshop called âAL-Rassefâ.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1894 size-full" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wp-meeting-alraseef-coffeshop.jpg" alt="WordPress Meeting in Taiz, Yemen" width="960" height="720" /></p>\n<p>Afterward, I presented a lecture about WordPress at Taiz University, in the same lecture hall I used to be a student in by that time. It was a warm beginning but I couldn&#8217;t continue due to my work and the deterioration of the political and security situation.</p>\n<h3>Disruption</h3>\n<p>Since 2011, my country has been facing major political changes and instability. On April 2015, the Yemeni crisis has reached its climax and war started in my city, Taiz, and it is still going on! Some of my relatives had decided to move out of Taiz but my father chose to stay, hoping that war will stop quickly. We lived for months without public electricity or Internet. When the fight crawled to our area, we lived for weeks in the ground floor of our house, no way to go out, tanks firing from 300 meters away, airstrikes on nearby areas, and snipers shooting whoever dared to walk on streets. Many friends and innocent people were killed and some members of my family were hurt. We couldn&#8217;t sleep for days, fearing that at any moment they will knock our house door.</p>\n<p>I thought that was the end for me and all of my dreams. I was pretending to be cool and calm so my younger brother and two sisters feel better. I was telling jokes, reading books or watching movies when we got some power from my uncle generator. &#8220;Life of Pi&#8221; was one of the movies we had watched and everyone enjoyed it! I refused to hold a gun, &#8220;How could it help?! That&#8217;s not my role in life!&#8221; I was thinking.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was struggling to believe in tomorrow, no matter how it looked miserable and sad.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In one of the mornings, after a nearby airstrike, we got a chance to escape. I tried to hold every detail of our house, neighborhood and street. &#8220;Thank you for all great memories. I will definitely return,&#8221; I told my house, feeling torn apart back then! I only took my laptop, tablet, and few clothes, they were all what I needed to start over.</p>\n<h3>Starting Over</h3>\n<blockquote><p>âYou canât connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something â your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.â<br />\nâ Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>\n<p>After some time of catching my breath, I realized that I had to connect the dots, keep on following my dreams and aim higher. On May 2016, I moved to Sana&#8217;a, the capital city of Yemen, leaving the pain and frustration behind. I got to know some enthusiastic developers and we decided to establish a community called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ydevclub/">Yemeni Developers Club</a> for people who are interested in computer programming and have the passion for it. We hold a meeting on the first Saturday of every month to share ideas, answer questions, and help one another to innovate, learn, and grow. We are planning to have, in the near future, special meetings to discuss WordPress related topics and learn how to obtain the maximum benefit from it.</p>\n<img class="wp-image-1895 size-full" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/taiz_and_sanaa_poster.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="420" />Photos for Ta&#8217;izz and Sana&#8217;a cites, photographed by Mona Athubhani.\n<h3>Amazing Melting Pot</h3>\n<div class="_h8t">\n<div id="js_jl2" class="_5wd9 direction_rtl">\n<div class="_5wde _n4o">\n<div class="_5w1r _3_om _5wdf">\n<div class="_4gx_">\n<div class="_d97"><span class="_5yl5">I am sure that WordPress helps thousands of developers, including me, be more independent, involves them to be parts of it, and offers opportunities to serve people from around the world.</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>WordPressÂ is such an amazing melting pot that contains people from everywhere, no matter how old they are, where they are from, or what languages they speak.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Become a Hero</h3>\n<p>Being a WordPress hero is not about programming skills or contributions size, it is all about the challenges we face and overcome.

At the click of a button, users can undo an action and restore a site&#8217;s database to a previousÂ point in history without having toÂ export and import MySQL.</p>\n<p>Borek Bernard, co-founder of VersionPress, saysÂ the move is the result of trying to overcome two major challenges: WordPress plugins and Hosts. WordPress plugins can alter a site&#8217;s database. Building <a href="https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/master/docs/Plugin-Support.md">in support</a> forÂ the 40K+ plugins that exist in the repository has been a huge undertaking for the team.</p>\n<p>In order to use VersionPress, a webhost needs to have <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> installed and allow proc_open which it uses to interact with Git. Most hosts do not allow proc_open for security reasons or have older versions of Git installed, generating incompatibilities. &#8220;Over time, it became clear we needed our own environment to run VersionPress in,&#8221; Bernard said.</p>\n<p>All sites hosted on the platform runÂ PHP 7 or Nginx, HTTP/2, and at least two Docker instances that auto-scale based on load. VersionPress.com includes the ability to set up staging and production sites using VersionPress&#8217; capabilities to merge changes between the two. Similar to <a href="https://getflywheel.com/why-flywheel/client-billing-transfer/">Flywheel</a>, billing can be assigned to a developer, agency, or client account. &#8220;The platform is geared towards WordPress developers and agencies but will help anyone who wants a fast, reliable WordPress site,&#8221; Bernard said.</p>\n<p>The model they&#8217;re using is similar to WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress. &#8220;A hosted service will provide resources to fund the development of the open source project and its long-term stability,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So it became a no-brainer at some point.&#8221; General availability for VersionPress.com won&#8217;t open until July but those who <a href="https://preview.versionpress.com/#preorder">pre-order</a> will receive a substantial discount.</p>\n<p>Bernard re-iterated that VersionPress will always be a free, open source project and that VersionPress.com is a major step towards bringing full version control of WordPress to the masses.</p>\n<p>The managed WordPress hosting space is well established and perhaps a bit crowded. It will be interesting to see how VersionPress.com compares to and fits in with the competition.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Jun 2017 21:45:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Matt: Remote Work Canât Be Stopped";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47433";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"https://ma.tt/2017/06/remote-work-cant-be-stopped/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:489:"<p>Christopher Mims writes for the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-remote-work-cant-be-stopped-1496577602?mg=prod/accounts-wsj">Why Remote Work Can&#8217;t Be Stopped</a>, also riffing off the <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/05/ibm-goes-non-remote/">IBM shift I wrote about a few weeks ago</a>.

Balkhi said the plugin will become the company&#8217;s go-to recommendation on WPForms as well as WPBeginner.</p>\n<p>Email deliverability is a common problem for all types of WordPress websites, but it is the most frequent support issue for those using WPForms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The number is only growing as Gmail, Yahoo, and others implement aggressive filters to reduce spam,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;These spam filters look to see whether an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from. This causes the emails sent from your WordPress site to either go in the spam folder or sometimes not be delivered at all! Having a proper SMTP solution significantly increases email deliverability. I believe that once we implement the new UX and workflow, this will significantly reduce our support load since this is the #1 issue our users deal with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After a few months of email exchanges, Balkhi and Callum MacDonald reached an agreement for WPForms to purchase WP Mail SMTP. Balkhi would not disclose the exact financial details of the acquisition but said it was &#8220;a five-figure-deal because the plugin itself did not generate any revenue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>MacDonald had considered monetizing the plugin in the past but saw too many hurdles as he became less active in the WordPress space over the past few years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a few recent developments around SMTP that mean the plugin could use an update,&#8221; MacDonald said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have the time, so it made sense to move on at this point. I went over [monetizing] it several times. My conclusion is that it&#8217;s a lot harder than it looks. If I was still active in the WordPress space, it would make more sense, but I&#8217;m not, so monetizing was going to be a long road and hard work. It made more sense to sell.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Balkhi said he approached MacDonald because email deliverability was a problem that he was looking to solve for WPForms users as well as the larger WPBeginner and WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to build an add-on for WPForms because the problem isn&#8217;t unique to just us,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;It affects every form plugin and basically every WordPress website that sends an email of any kind (forgot password, user registration, etc).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last year Balkhi and his team acquired <a href="https://wptavern.com/syed-balkhi-acquires-google-analytics-by-yoast-renames-to-monsterinsights" target="_blank">Yoast&#8217;s Google Analytics and renamed it to MonsterInsights</a>. Over the past year the plugin has continued its growth from 10 million downloads at the time of acquisition to more than 16 million today.</p>\n<p>Balkhi reports that the MonsterInsights acquisition has been a success but the product was a very different type of acquisition from the one announced today. He said he has no plans to build an email deliverability service but rather wants to invest in a solution that will help his customers and others in the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin users can expect improvements to the plugin and a more &#8220;beginner-friendly&#8221; redesign, which Balkhi anticipates to release at the end of Q3 or Q4 of 2017.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of growing our WPForms&#8217; user base through WP Mail SMTP, that&#8217;s not our primary goal,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;Our top priority is to solve the email deliverability issue that our existing users and the larger WordPress community faces.&#8221; Balkhi said he hopes to leverage the 600,000+ user base to negotiate better deals with established email deliverability services.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Jun 2017 20:12:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WPTavern: Cory Miller and Dr. Sherry Walling Launch ZenTribes an Entrepreneur Peer Group";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71006";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"https://wptavern.com/cory-miller-and-dr-sherry-walling-launch-zentribes-an-entrepreneur-peer-group";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3202:"<p>Being an entrepreneur can be stressful, emotional, and lonely, especially during a rough part of life.

As the core team has more collective knowledge of working with React, they have reached out to developers with different experiences of using other frameworks in a  WordPress context.</p>\n<p>One of the chief concerns contributors have regarding Vue is the longevity of the project. I asked Vue creator <a href="http://evanyou.me/" target="_blank">Evan You</a> if he could weigh in on the topic to give WordPress contributors a better understanding of the project, specifically regarding his efforts to cultivate additional maintainers to help share the load of maintainership.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s important to look at the track record &#8211; Vue has been around for almost 4 years, and all the work has been done in public on GitHub so anyone can go and check the maintenance history,&#8221; You said. &#8220;While it has been largely developed by me, the current maintenance is a lot more community-driven. We have active core team members triaging most of the issues and a larger and larger percentage of the issues fixed by community PRs. So &#8211; yes, I had already been working on cultivating additional maintainers and will continue to do so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You currently receives <a href="https://www.patreon.com/evanyou" target="_blank">$10K/month from recurring Patreon donations</a> that fund his full-time efforts working on Vue. Prior to this he also worked at Google and Meteor. During his time at Google, some of the projects You worked on used Angular, which he said he found to be too heavy for his use cases at the time. He built Vue.js to be a more lightweight implementation of the concepts that he liked about Angular.</p>\n<p>You also recently said he has learned quite a bit from the React community, which has influenced some of his technical decisions in Vue 2.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I learned a lot from the React community &#8211; on both code and people. I hope everyone can be like <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov">@dan_abramov</a>. Peace.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Evan You (@youyuxi) <a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/869020366705799168">May 29, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;First, Vue 2 uses the same Virtual DOM based rendering model underneath, which was first pioneered by React,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Introducing a Virtual DOM allowed Vue to expose the power of vdom composition while maintaining the approachability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The React community is also very active when there are new problem domains being explored &#8211; e.g. state management and CSS management. There are many competing solutions and a lot of inspirations when I was implementing official solutions for Vue.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Evan You Addresses WordPress Core Contributors&#8217; Misconceptions about Vue.js</h3>\n<p>You said he has been following WordPress contributors&#8217; discussions on React vs Vue but would not offer an opinion on which is a better choice for the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My answer would obviously be biased, and honestly I&#8217;m not in the shoes of the WP core team so I don&#8217;t have enough perspective to make a choice,&#8221; You said. &#8220;However, I can provide feedback on some of the issues being discussed in hope of helping them make a better-informed decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You left a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/31/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-30th/#comment-32642" target="_blank">comment</a> on the most recent Javascript meeting notes with clarifications on a few misunderstandings about Vue.js. You addressed the point regarding &#8220;embracing JavaScript the language,&#8221; as some contributors think Vue&#8217;s templating language obscures the underlying JavaScript.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think &#8217;embracing JavaScript the language&#8217; is another primitive of React we donât see in Vue,&#8221; Andrew Duthie <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1496150274570299" target="_blank">said</a> during the last meeting.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;s reply compares Vue&#8217;s use of templates as &#8220;syntax sugar for view representation on top of HTML&#8221; to what he believes to be a similar usage in the case of JSX as view representation on top of JavaScript:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The increasing richness of UI does NOT necessitate putting everything in JavaScript. On the other hand, just because Vue uses templates by default doesnât mean it allows people to get by without learning JavaScript properly.</p>\n<p>Vueâs templates are compiled into JavaScript render functions under the hood and they are actually closer to JavaScript than to traditional string templating. Itâs just a layer of syntax sugar on top of the underlying Virtual DOM representation. Think of JSX as syntax sugar for view representation on top of JS; Vue templates are syntax sugar for view representation on top of HTML.</p>\n<p>JSX/Raw JS does provide more flexibility when you need to apply direct manipulation of Virtual DOM nodes, this is why Vue also supports render functions. But this is not putting two opposing paradigms under the same tent â itâs simply allowing the user to skip the syntax sugar layer for more control.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You said the idea behind templating on top of render functions is to provide &#8220;better approachability,&#8221; a concern shared by many other proponents of WordPress adopting Vue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Users who are more comfortable with HTML and have simpler use cases could use the template, while users who are already familiar of JSX/render functions can leverage the full power of JS,&#8221; You said. &#8220;This would fit pretty nicely for the use of WP core: community users who care about approachability have an easier time getting started, while the core team have access to JSX/render functions for advanced use cases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You also addressed the concern of longevity by offering more information on Vue&#8217;s development processes. He confirmed that the current codebase is largely developed by him alone, but maintenance is spread across a core team with members all over the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Other contributors have lower commit counts because their contributions are all submitted in the form of PRs and we use the &#8216;Squash and commit&#8217; feature on GitHub so each PR results in only one commit for the contributor,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Weâve merged close to 500 PRs in the core repo alone, and many more across the organization. Other repos under the vuejs organization, e.g. vuex, vue-router, vuejs.org are also largely maintained by dedicated team members.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You also offered clarification on questions of stability and future compatibility, as WordPress contributors presented concerns regarding breaking changes in the templating language in Vue 2.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This begs for some clarification: Vue versioning strictly follows semver,&#8221; You said. &#8220;The only time there had been breaking API changes post 1.0 was the 2.0 bump. The template syntax is part of the API so itâs not going to [break], and in between major version bumps we commit to 100% API backwards compatibility. We take stability very seriously, so do our community and in-production users, including GitLab, Vice, and some of the biggest internet companies in China.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As many WordPress core contributors have been developing on top of React for years, You&#8217;s input offers a more detailed, in-depth look at Vue that contributors have been asking for during various rounds of feedback. The discussion will continue over the next several weeks and contributors plan to include the topic at WordCamp Europe&#8217;s contributor summit.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Jun 2017 18:04:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: Open Sourcing Mental Illness Surpasses $50K Fundraising Goal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71138";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"https://wptavern.com/open-sourcing-mental-illness-surpases-50k-fundraising-goal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3035:"<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mental-health-in-tech-2016.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://osmihelp.org/" target="_blank">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a> (OSMI), a non-profit organization that raises mental health awareness in the tech community, has <a href="https://osmihelp.org/blog/fundraising-2017-recap" target="_blank">surpassed its $50K fundraising goal</a> for 2017. Ed Finkler, who founded OSMI in 2013, left his position as CTO of <a href="https://www.graphstory.com/" target="_blank">Graph Story</a> to work full-time on speaking, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. As of today, the campaign has raised more than $58,000.</p>\n<p>In addition to donations from individuals, OSMI has added several corporate sponsors, including CakeDC, Github, Digital Ocean, and Laravel. CakeDC has designated $1,000/month for 12 months to support Finkler&#8217;s salary. Finkler works together with a board of directors and a team of volunteers who also speak at conferences about mental health in tech. Several WordPress companies have also been involved in raising support for OSMI, including <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/opensourcingmentalillness-704978" target="_blank">WebDevStudios</a> and <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-elevation-is-focusing-all-content-on-mental-health-for-month-of-may" target="_blank">WP Elevation</a>.</p>\n<p>OSMI conducts an annual Mental Health in Tech survey as part of ongoing research. Last year&#8217;s survey received more than 1,500 responses and the results underscore the great need for removing the stigma surrounding mental illness in the tech industry. A few examples Finkler highlighted include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respondents believe it&#8217;s 6 times more likely that discussing a mental health issue with their employer would have a negative consequence, vs a physical health issue.</li>\n<li>Respondents are 3.5 times less likely to bring up a mental health issue in an interview than a physical health issue.</li>\n<li>87% believe being identified as a person with a mental health issue would hurt their career.</li>\n<li>Only 30% of respondents&#8217; employers provide information about mental health and how to seek help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OSMI offers all of the resources it creates for free. The funds raised in the campaign will help to create more tools, documents, videos, and other educational resources. Finkler is working towards engaging with more HR departments and educating more executive teams. He also plans to use the funds to do more research and employ additional experts to reach more people.</p>\n<p>For more information about OSMI&#8217;s efforts to improve mental health in the tech industry, check out Jeff Chandler&#8217;s <a href="https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-273-mental-health-awareness-with-bridget-willard-and-ed-finkler" target="_blank">recent interview with Finkler on the WP Weekly podcast</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Jun 2017 03:59:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It â Issue 21";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=71142&preview=true&preview_id=71142";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-21";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6022:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-50955"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>Thereâs a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern.

Their popularity isÂ why WordPress has featured images and automatic thumbnail generation in core.</p>\n<h2>Highlights From Season Four of ManageWP&#8217;s Ask Me Anything</h2>\n<p>ManageWP <a href="https://managewp.com/ama-season-4-highlights">published highlights</a> from season four of Ask Me Anything, a weekly event where membersÂ of the WordPress community voluntarily answer any questions submitted.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8 Field Guide</h2>\n<p>Everything you need to know to prepare for WordPress 4.8, tentatively scheduled for release on June 8th, is in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/-field-guide/">the field guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>Take the WPCampus WordPress in Higher Education Survey</h2>\n<p>WPCampus is once again asking for those who work with WordPress in educational settings to fill out the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/wpcampus17">following survey</a>.Â This year, three randomly selected participants will receive a free ticket to attend WPCampus in Buffalo, NY, July 14-15.</p>\n<p>The data will be used to create a series of reports on how WordPress is used in public schools and higher education.Â <a href="https://wptavern.com/wpcampus-survey-results-indicate-misconceptions-of-wordpress-are-slowing-its-growth-in-higher-education">Last year&#8217;s survey</a> indicated that misconceptions surrounding WordPress security and scalability are slowing its growth inÂ higher education.</p>\n<h2>A Plugin for Monitoring Directory Sizes</h2>\n<p>David Bisset shared aÂ dashboard widget that displaysÂ the sizes of directories.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">WordPress dashboard widget that displays directory sizes, in case you need to keep an eye on that for some reason. <a href="https://t.co/eWu6cxtze7">https://t.co/eWu6cxtze7</a> <a href="https://t.co/bPOgXVkwvL">pic.twitter.com/bPOgXVkwvL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/870081713036181504">June 1, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Stop Signup SpamÂ Integrates with GiveWP</h2>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-signup-spam/">Stop Signup Spam</a>, a plugin we <a href="https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-blocks-spam-user-registrations-using-stop-forum-spam-database">featured last month</a>Â now integrates with GiveWP.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My "Stop Signup Spam" plugin now integrates with <a href="https://twitter.com/GiveWP">@GiveWP</a>, thanks to a contribution from <a href="https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc">@learnwithmattc</a>! <a href="https://t.co/hmHBxxKEki">https://t.co/hmHBxxKEki</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Leland Fiegel (@lelandf) <a href="https://twitter.com/lelandf/status/869976727912579073">May 31, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>LED WordPress Badge</h2>\n<p>George Stephanis unveiled his wifi-enabled light up WordPress badge on Twitter.

The new desktop app is in early beta at version 0.2.0 with version 1.0.0 coming soon.</p>\n<p>Chassis Desktop was designed with a user-friendly interface suitable for beginners and experts alike. It was built by Bronson Quick and Ryan McCue using <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a> and contains code from the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" target="_blank">create-react-app</a> project.</p>\n<p>On first launch the app makes sure that Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed and then guides the user to create a new box. Setting up a new Chassis install or adding Chassis to an existing install is fast and easy with the simple UI. The app also includes keyboard navigation and a built-in terminal for quick access to more control over your box.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/add-new-box.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Over the years Chassis contributors have created an ecosystem of <a href="http://beta.chassis.io/extensions/" target="_blank">extensions</a> for things like MailHog, Photon, Memcache, debugging, and other software. These add-ons allow users to tailor their systems to their needs.</p>\n<p>Chassis Desktop aims to make it easy for users to manager their Chassis development environments without having to touch the command line. As it is currently in pre-release status, early adopters may discover some bugs. Beta testers are encouraged to <a href="https://github.com/Chassis/Desktop/issues" target="_blank">log any issues on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Jun 2017 03:24:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.8 Release Candidate 2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4765";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/-release-candidate-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1160:"<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 4.8 is now available.</p>\n<p>To test WordPress 4.8, you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/-RC2.zip">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/?action=stop_on_copy&mode=stop_on_copy&rev=40866&stop_rev=40847">a handful of changes</a> since releasing RC 1 last week.

Here are a few examples of WordPress data it can log:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log any failed logins</li>\n<li>Keep track of all WordPress cron requests</li>\n<li>Intercept the WordPress-specific exit function, wp_die(), and log any (direct or indirect) usage</li>\n<li>PHP core notices, warnings and (fatal) errors, uncaught exceptions (as well as PHP 7+ Throwable)</li>\n<li>WordPress core errors such as database errors, HTTP API errors, wp_mail() errors, and 404 errors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wonolog is available as a Composer package and its creators recommend installing at the website level. Inpsyde has been using it successfully in production with different projects for several months. Wonolog requires PHP 5.6 or higher and WordPress 4.6+.

This is the second release since the project was <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-gets-official-wordpress-org-support" target="_blank">brought under the official WordPress umbrella</a> and the first major release since <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-names-alain-schlesser-new-co-maintainer" target="_blank">hiring Alain Schlesser as a part-time co-maintainer</a>.</p>\n<p>Splitting WP-CLI&#8217;s internal commands into separate packages moves the project closer to the goal of having official maintainers for the commands in the future. This new structure for the framework and its commands provides several benefits, as outlined by co-maintainer Daniel Bachhuber in the release post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While developing, the tests are only run for the specific component youâre working on, making the feedback loop much shorter.</li>\n<li>Individual command packages can be controlled and set up independently, opening up the opportunity for better collaboration.</li>\n<li>Hotfixes and intermediary releases can be published for individual commands, that can then be updated through the built-in package manager.</li>\n<li>Tests run really fast now.</li>\n<li>When you submit a pull request, you donât have to wait two hours for the tests to run.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release also includes three new commands, along with dozens of command improvements and framework enhancements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>wp config get</code> lists constants and globals defined in wp-config.php</li>\n<li><code>wp config path</code> gets the path to wp-config.php</li>\n<li><code>wp db size</code> gets the size of the database and its tables</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version 1.2.0 had 43 contributors, a 95% increase in contributors from the previous release. One of the next priorities for maintainers is to improve the contribution workflow. Bachhuber said there are no plans at the moment to bring on additional paid co-maintainers, but they plan to start onboarding more volunteer committers. These are developers who are involved with the project on a regular basis but not necessarily daily or weekly. They have also created a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/good-first-issues/" target="_blank">Good First Issues page</a> for new contributors and have started working on a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/dash/" target="_blank">customized dashboard for committers</a>.</p>\n<h3>WP-CLI Has a New Logo</h3>\n<p>Bachhuber introduced the project&#8217;s new logo today, designed by Chris Wallace and his team at <a href="https://liftux.com/" target="_blank">Lift UX</a>. Having an official logo opens up the possibility for WP-CLI swag. Bachhuber said he worked with contributors to create a logo, because &#8220;people can develop stronger emotional affinity to brands with logos (myself included).&#8221; He is also interested in getting stickers created, particularly ones that glow in the dark, but has not yet found a producer. Bachhuber said he is hoping to have some preliminary WP-CLI swag for WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:17:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WPTavern: Pods 2.7 Beta Introduces Flexible Relationships, Rewrites Fields in JavaScript";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71009";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"https://wptavern.com/pods-2-7-beta-introduces-flexible-relationships-rewrites-fields-in-javascript";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2272:"<p>Pods Framework has released two new versions. <a href="http://pods.io/2017/05/30/pods-2-6-9-maintenance-release/">Pods 2.6.9</a> is a maintenance release that includes bug fixes for Pods Templates, Auto Templates, and Pods Shortcodes.

Limiting the discussion to prior contributors or collaborators can help keep input focused around the ideas of those who are already invested in the project.</p>\n<p>Reactions to the new feature have been mostly positive, although some users don&#8217;t anticipate using it much since <a href="https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments" target="_blank">GitHub added emoji reactions to conversations</a> last year. In addition to keeping threads from becoming unreadable with numerous +1&#8217;s, emoji reactions as an option for expression should help limit interactions from those prone to &#8220;drive-by&#8221; commenting.</p>\n<p>A curated repository of &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/nikolas/github-drama" target="_blank">GitHub Drama</a>,&#8221; which includes projects like Bower, Docker, Django, and NodeJS, lists many instances wherein temporarily limiting interaction may have changed the overall tone of the discourse.

Some users have also requested a convenient way for repository members to warn an individual without spamming the entire thread or to put specific users in a cool down period.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s a legit heated discussion and you limit it, then you&#8217;re just [going] to come back in 24 hours to very long, impossible-to-follow responses,&#8221; Kris Siegel, Senior Engineer at PlayStation, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14448871" target="_blank">commented</a> on the related Hacker News thread. &#8220;At least this has been my experience when people have left things to cool down them come back and need to respond to everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub is aiming to promote healthier discussions with the new interaction limiting feature, but every project&#8217;s community is unique and maintainers may not be able to predict user reactions to locking down an entire repository. If the feature is turned on when a new user is attempting to create their first pull request, it may hinder future contribution.  Open source project maintainers should carefully consider the effects of silencing non-contributors when using the feature.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 31 May 2017 20:35:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"HeroPress: Building A WordPress Career in India";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1874";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:136:"https://heropress.com/essays/building-wordpress-career-india/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=building-wordpress-career-india";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10728:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/053117-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: Give your children the room to grow." /><p>6 years back, Iâd have never thought I would be where I am right now. At that time, I was a 12-year-old wondering how softwaresÂ were made. Despite the fact that I was born in a middle-class Indian family, my parents never forced me to opt for something I wasnât interested in. Unlike other middle-class Indian children, the bar of expectations wasnât set that high and I think it turned out to be for the best.</p>\n<p>My parents always supported me and constantly motivated me to learn whatever I liked. Eventually, from wondering about how software was made, I started wondering same about websites. For some reason, I felt more interested in websites than software. For starters, I felt coding in HTML was easier than working with C/C++</p>\n<p>Now that Iâve bored you already, letâs get to know each other too. I am <a href="http://technobooz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suyogya Shukla</a>, a WordPress developer from Kanpur, India. I work with <a href="https://themeisle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThemeIsle</a> as a Support Ninja where I make sure our users are always happy with our products. Letâs go ahead now.</p>\n<h3>The Journey</h3>\n<p>At the age of 12; still in class 6th, I started to learn about web coding. I started with HTML and learned how to make a really basic webpage. After understanding the basic concepts I wanted to start making a website already. I went ahead and googled &#8211; âHow to make a free websiteâ and the webs.com&#8217;s listing lead the page. I immediately clicked on it and started playing around, until I realized that it was WYSIWYG editor and it wasnât possible for me to customize it a lot (Not that I knew how to!)</p>\n<p>At this time I had no idea about domain names and hosting. I researched some more and was introduced to the process of putting your website online, but it cost money! I decided to make a small website locally and then show it to my dad hoping heâd be impressed and provide me with the money I needed to put it online. While learning HTML, I came across this cool language called Â âCSSâ which would apparently make a website look and work better.</p>\n<p>Next thing you know, I was all over w3schools.com and YouTube watching videos about CSS, playing with the examples and much more. It took me a good 2 weeks to understand the basic concepts. I could finally change fonts, play with colors and do a lot more! While I liked how I had more control when I coded my own website, I still missed the easy content management webs.com and other WYSIWYG tools offered. This had me thinking again. What free software can I use to have the same level of control over my website but is just as easy to use when it comes to content management? This, in turn, initiated another research and I was finally introduced to this awesome software which went by the name of âWordPressâ!</p>\n<p>Over the years I would work on a lot of WordPress based websites and continue to learn more about it every day. I worked for various small design agencies, as a freelancer and a lot more until one fine day in 2016 when I saw a âhiringâ notice on <a href="https://themeisle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThemeIsle&#8217;s</a> website and decided to give it a shot. After an initial trial period of some 2 weeks, I was hired. I worked part-time (three hours/day, to be exact) for a year because I had school. Two months back, I started working full time. I work with the support and development team (more involved in support as of now, but I eventually want to get into full-time development) where I continue to learn new things every day.</p>\n<h3>Itâs a Real Career Option!</h3>\n<p>For everyone who thinks WordPress is just a blogging tool, youâre wrong! Sure, itâs a blogging tool but it is used for so much more. Itâs a real career option with a lot of room for growth. Given you are passionate about WordPress and the technologies used in it, youâd be able to find a job easily.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The best thing about the WordPress ecosystem is the people. Theyâre just so nice!</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress ecosystem is indeed competitive like any other but in the best way possible. Even if youâre another company wanting to know how some other company manages things or what technologies they use, they wonât hesitate to tell you about it. Almost all of the WordPress enthusiasts go to WordCamps where they meet new people and share knowledge.</p>\n<p>Another good thing about choosing WordPress as a career? The flexibility. A large part of the people who work on WordPress, do it remotely. The company WordPress.com, Automattic, is a completely distributed team with people working from different parts of the world. Want even more reasons to choose WordPress? The earning potential. Companies in the WordPress ecosystem are known to pay generously and the best part? You get to work with the folks who are just as passionate about WordPress as you are.</p>\n<h3>Engineering isnât the only way to go</h3>\n<p>This is for all the Indian parents who are pushing their children to join coachings for IIT and other examinations right now, without their children wanting to &#8211; DONâT. Engineering isnât the only way one can get a job. Sure, thereâs nothing wrong with it but forcing your children to do it because you think thereâs no other way? That isnât right.</p>\n<p>Introduce your children to WordPress, introduce them to the world of web programming and see if they like it. Why not promote them to do something they like than to burden them with the weight of engineering when they donât like it?</p>\n<blockquote><p>For all I know if my parents had forced me into engineering I wouldâve missed out on everything. Give your children the room to grow.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Make them learn new things, introduce them to WordPress and all other cool things ( not just tech related! ) and leave it up to them to choose a career path <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="?" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<h3>Working Remotely Is Fun</h3>\n<p>Letâs talk about working remotely now. Itâs fun. You donât have to wear a suit or any kind of uniform. You get to work in your PJs. Does it get any better than that? Oh wait, it does. You get to choose your working hours. You can decide to work 3hrs in morning and 3hrs at night or you can work 6hours at a stretch. Fellow night crawler? You can work at night. Apart from that, it gives you a lot of freedom. You can work from wherever you want. You can go to a beach and work. You can work while traveling, basically, you can decide to work from anywhere, anytime! Itâs all up to you.</p>\n<p>Flexible working hours allow me to concentrate on learning new things on a personal level and maintain a healthy Work/ Life balance. But over time, you might get bored working from home. ( Not sure about you but it did happen with me! )</p>\n<blockquote><p>My two cents? Take some time out and go vacationing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Join a co-working space and see if that helps. All in all, I love having the freedom to work from anywhere and the best part still remains that I can work while wearing my PJs.</p>\n<h3>Whatâs Next?</h3>\n<p>Let me put it this way; I love WordPress. I have been doing some UI/UX work for a while now and I liked it. I am planning to learn more about it while learning more about WordPress development in parallel. For now, I am starting a small WordPress studio, <a href="http://madewithwp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Made With WP</a>, with my friends (and colleagues) &#8211; Hardeep and Rohit. <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/be-your-own-teacher/">You might remember Hardeep talking about it in his essay</a>. Itâs the same project. I am working on my first WordPress theme and hope to see it in the theme directory soon.

The discussion on the Make/Core <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/" target="_blank">post</a> intensified over the weekend with more Vue.js proponents commenting to add their thoughts.</p>\n<p>Adam Silverstein and Andrew Duthie facilitated this morning&#8217;s meeting and began by opening up the discussion to include other frameworks such as Preact, Angular, and Ember. However, the discussion quickly narrowed to React vs Vue.</p>\n<p>Silverstein encouraged participants to remember that the new framework is for use with new features such as the new editor and that they will continue to use Backbone when it is the right tool, as well as in existing JavaScript. He also emphasized that the discussion pertains to a framework for core and developers are free to use whatever framework they choose to build plugins or themes.</p>\n<h3>Vue.js Proponents Consider &#8220;Ease of Learning&#8221; an Important Factor in Selecting a New Framework</h3>\n<p>Ease of learning is not among the criteria contributors identified for selecting a new framework, but it is one of the major concerns for Vue.js proponents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Vue can do everything that React can do and is much more approachable,&#8221; Justin Kopepasah said. &#8220;There is a huge adoption of Vue and growth does not show any signs of stopping. Some of the top open source frameworks have adopted Vue and it is used by the top three tech companies in China (including Alibaba). While I do agree that React is a good choice as well, it is not highly approachable by new developers and has Facebook behind it which can be very alarming for people in many ways (not just tech).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Justin Tadlock, a core contributor whose code and tutorials have assisted many developers learning WordPress, shared similar thoughts over the weekend on the Mare/Core post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Iâve tried React on a few occasions. Even with over 10 years of programming experience, it was tough to grok for me. I canât imagine trying to learn it as someone new to WP development.</p>\n<p>Vue is dead simple to start learning. I had a small app up and going in minutes. In a couple of hours, I was building some cool, form-related stuff without the docs.</p>\n<p>If it were entirely up to me, Iâd push for WP to build its own JS framework that solves the problems specific to WordPress. But, if weâre going to choose an existing framework, go with Vue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matias Ventura, an Automattic engineer and contributor on both the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso" target="_blank">Calypso</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/" target="_blank">Gutenberg</a> projects, is a proponent of WordPress adopting React. He contends that considering which is easier to learn is the wrong focus for determining what WordPress&#8217; future interfaces will need.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion, instead of &#8216;easier to get started,&#8217; we need to look at robust programming paradigms and an expressive approach to coding interfaces,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;This is what I fundamentally take from Mattâs &#8216;learn JavaScript deeply&#8217; &#8211; the corollary being that WordPress becomes a platform for teaching JavaScript to new programmers, and we need to take that seriously, not just as a convenience to us in the short term.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura also noted that WordPress has historically not been successful in attracting JavaScript developers and the JS interfaces in core lack contributors when compared to the PHP side.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have an opportunity to make WordPress development more appealing to a newer generation of developers that learned how to code through JavaScript,&#8221; Ventura said. He encouraged other participants to examine the kinds of interfaces that WordPress needs to modernize and select the best framework for handling them in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The &#8216;easier to get started&#8217; [argument] seems a bit fallacious to me,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Easier to whom? At what cost to properly learning JavaScript? The demands of rich interfaces in web applications require a deeper understanding of the technologies used. Thatâs not something we can avoid. JavaScript cannot be seen as mere progressive enhancement anymore as it is the language in which modern interfaces are expressed.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Contributors are Concerned about React being Backed by Facebook</h3>\n<p>At the moment, React is more established and more widely adopted than Vue, but contributors are concerned about the framework being backed and licensed by Facebook. In addition to concerns over the interpretation of React&#8217;s additional <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-will-continue-to-use-react-js-in-calypso-despite-patent-clause" target="_blank">patent grant</a>, the company has been the source of numerous controversies regarding censorship, data mining, and privacy, among other issues. Opponents don&#8217;t want to see WordPress hitch its wagon to Facebook by using React in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The adoption of React is much more than adding a library to WordPress: it is adding the culture, business practices, and code base led by a tech giant,&#8221; Justin Kopepasah <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/#comment-32557" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;If we include React in Core, in a way we are asking users (from single site owners to enterprise) to accept Facebook has a key role in the future of WordPress. I have little doubt this will cause pause for some companies considering to adopt WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, other contributors have concerns about Vue.js&#8217; longevity, because it&#8217;s so heavily dependent on its creator Evan You. You <a href="https://www.patreon.com/evanyou" target="_blank">funds his efforts on Patreon</a> but the project doesn&#8217;t have any major corporate backing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m uncomfortable relying on a project run by a single person that could disappear,&#8221; React proponent and WP REST API co-lead Ryan McCue said. &#8220;Being run by a corporation with a stake in the game means long-term support and relative stability.&#8221; McCue also noted that React has a &#8220;a massive community of teaching and support out there for people learning.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Many Feel WordPress Selecting React as the New JS Framework is a Foregone Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Despite all the discussions in meetings and on Make/Core posts, many onlookers and community members are convinced that WordPress choosing React is a foregone conclusion. At the beginning of last week&#8217;s discussion it seemed that most core contributors are in favor of React, but a strong contingent of Vue proponents have turned out to add comments to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/" target="_blank">discussion</a>.</p>\n<p>Selecting React appears to be the only viable choice when the criteria from the beginning includes items like &#8220;proven in a WordPress context&#8221; and &#8220;alignment with Calypso.&#8221; Many have commented to say that the criteria is biased and they assume the decision was already made through the backchannels with a public discussion held for &#8220;optics.&#8221; Automattic engineer James Nylen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/876" target="_blank">commented</a> last week on an open ticket for the Gutenberg project, saying that &#8220;Per recent discussion in core Slack, WP core has basically decided to adopt React.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If this was truly meant to be a community discussion, then why is it taking place now?&#8221; WordPress developer Christopher A. <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-select-new-javascript-framework-for-use-in-core#comment-221446" target="_blank">commented</a> on our recent post that summarized the initial discussion. &#8220;Choosing a view framework should have happened before the first line of Gutenberg was written. It was known from the start that a view framework would be needed. It was Mattâs desire to get it off the ground as quickly as possible. The best way to accomplish this was to utilize Automattic developers who have experience with React.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress is selecting a JavaScript framework at a time where frameworks are rapidly evolving, but contributors involved in the decision said they will preserve the ability for theme and plugin developers to use any framework they choose to build their products. No framework was selected during today&#8217;s meeting and Andrew Duthie said he expects the conversation will continue at WordCamp Europe&#8217;s contributor summit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As to React vs Vue (vs Angular vs â¦), weâve been discussing the arguments for and against each in the weekly chat, and weâre intentionally taking it slow,&#8221; Ryan McCue said. &#8220;The key criteria that weâve picked come from what the project needs, and are not intended to bias the decision in a specific direction. Calypso and other projects are a strong signal towards React, but theyâre not the ultimate argument (if they were, we wouldnât even be discussing it).&#8221;</p>\n<p>McCue said he doesn&#8217;t see WordPress replacing the whole admin with Calypso in a way that doesn&#8217;t allow developers to use whatever they choose for their own extensions. The decision to adopt a JavaScript framework for core is more for making core developers&#8217; work easier. At this time, core developers working on new features have a greater knowledge of React than other frameworks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, we need to make a decision on what to use in core, and that decision directly impacts the people working on core,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;Picking one framework over another doesnât mean the others are worse, itâs just us (as core contributors) trying to make our own development easier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A summary of the discussion should be posted to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/" target="_blank">Make/Core blog</a> soon and the discussion on selecting a new JavaScript framework will continue in future meetings.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 May 2017 23:15:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"BuddyPress: Building Bridges between Students and Educators in Nepal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://buddypress.org/?p=266185";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"https://buddypress.org/2017/05/building-bridges-between-students-and-educators-in-nepal/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9321:"<div><em>This is a guest post by Arjun Bhattarai (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aju29">aju29</a>), Founder and Developer of <a href="http://studentsnepal.com/">StudentsNepal.com</a>.

The site helps students find answers to popular courses and colleges by acting as a bridge between the students and educators/educational organizations.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>I started working on this side project in December 2014. I remembered I had very little information about courses and colleges I could choose from after finishing Higher Secondary level back in 2011. There were no websites that could readily help students to explore the various opportunities available in Nepal. There are still a lot of students in Nepal who have been brain-fed that studying abroad is the one and only option to be successful. My vision was to change this mindset among the young students of Nepal by informing them about the abundant opportunities and options available within the country.</p>\n<p>The goal for creating StudentsNepal is to increase communication among different students with different educational backgrounds while helping them to learn all sorts of information and get hold of educational resources. Communication and interaction are the core values of StudentsNepal and these are the features that help the platform stand out from rest of the educational websites. BuddyPress and bbPress have helped us to achieve these values in a cost effective and efficient way. The beauty of these plugins is that our members can create content and help to rank us higher with search engines.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>The investment to create StudentsNepal.com was very low, a fraction of my pocket money during my final years in college. It is now one of the top educational portals of Nepal. Since WordPress was so easy to master, my dev team and I were able to use most of our free time to create initial content and other valuable resources for our visitors &#8211; students, parents, and educators &#8211; rather than spending time/money coding from scratch or buying a proprietary platform.</p>\n<p>Before choosing BuddyPress, I researched open-source social network scripts and platforms. My shortlist included WordPress (BuddyPress), Joomla (JomSocial), and Drupal (social modules). It was clear to me, after reading a lot of support forum posts and articles, that the BuddyPress/WordPress combo was the way to move forward with my dream. I am really happy about this choice today. The other heavyweight plugins that I added were GravityForms, Sucuri, bbPress, and MyCred plus other smaller plugins for specific tasks.</p>\n<h2>Customizations &amp; Improvements</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Login and Registration Pages</strong><br />\nWe found out that the default login and registration pages made it difficult for members to log in and have kept site visitors from registering. We resolved the issues by installing the Gravity Forms plugin and adding log in integration via Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ as well as making the registration page more user-friendly.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266188" src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/studentsnepal-login.png" alt="studentsnepal login screen" width="1349" height="673" /></p>\n<p><strong>2. Newsletters</strong><br />\nI thought about adding a newsletter because I loved the way some of the blogs I subscribed to sent organized information and recent activities of the blog in a beautiful email format. I decided to add an optin form to start collecting names and emails 2 to 3 months after launching the site. During the first 6 months, only first names and emails were collected with the popup optin form. Later, I changed the optin forms to collect email addresses and phone numbers. I have been using the free package of mailmunch for optin forms (popups) and Amazon AWS for sending newsletters. The newsletter contains scholarship notices for different universities/colleges, student stories, youth events, and other useful academic information.</p>\n<p>The newsletters have become one of the most popular features for the community. We did a lot of testing for the positioning and timing of the popup to get the most sign ups. StudentsNepal had around 20,000 subscribers by the end of 2015. The number of subscribers started growing after I inserted the forms in all the subdomains. (news.studentsnepal.com, jobs.studentsnepal.com, quiz.studentsnepal.com, blog.studentsnepal.com). After 3 years, the site has 50,000+ subscribers.</p>\n<p>Currently, StudentsNepal sends 1 newsletter per week, and my dev team and I are planning to make it 2 newsletters per week. We had invited students and educators/institutions to contribute content for the newsletters and the response has been just great! Students, particularly, submit generously and regularly to benefit other members, subscribers, and online visitors.</p>\n<p>In addition, this project has also helped me connect with lots of awesome individuals and similar-minded startup owners.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Design and CSS tweaks</strong><br />\nOut of the box, BuddyPress has a plain and simple design and interfaces which can be customized easily. At the end of the day, the features and performance are what matters most to my users whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop. For me, due to extensibility and ease of customization, BuddyPress reigns as king when it comes to a free open source script for a social network.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266198" src="https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/Forums-Archive.png" alt="Forums Archive" width="1349" height="1957" /></p>\n<p><strong>4. Upgrading Servers</strong><br />\nStudentsNepal.com was on a shared hosting plan when I launched it in 2014. It took around 3 to 4 months to cross the benchmark of 500 visitors/day. After getting articles indexed in search engines and started getting higher ranks, StudentsNepal started getting a lot of visitors (especially from Google). Mid-2015 we upgraded to VPS hosting when the websiteâs articles and contents started getting listed on the 1st page of search engines and it started getting a couple of thousand visitors daily. Based on my experience, itâs a good decision to get a shared hosting plan while the site was starting out and then upgrade to more powerful hosting plan when data showed the increases in user engagement and participation.</p>\n<p>With a community of 9,700 registered members, 50k subscribers, and around 150k visitors/month, I am happy to say that our site runs smoothly with nary a downtime on all devices. If you install BuddyPress, you will need a bit more power on your server.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast Forward</strong></p>\n<p>Future plans for StudentsNepal.com include moving the Shopping and Jobs sections to separate domains and setting up a new site for online classes. I am testing Woocommerce, WP Job Manager, and Moodle for the other projects to expand our services to the community.</p>\n<p>If you are creating a site for any niche community and are not sure on which platform to choose, I definitely suggest using WordPress with BuddyPress. These have a lot of stable and robust add-on plugins to help you create awesome and feature-rich communities.</p>\n<p>StudentsNepal.com is the first website of its nature in Nepal and it has garnered a lot of media attention and praise. I received a lot of positive and encouraging messages from educators and students in Nepal for creating this platform. Iâm just glad that the services provided by the site have been very helpful to so many Nepalese students as well to those who would like to study in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Thanks to WordPress and BuddyPress for making this site possible.

I browsed the plugin directory to see if anyone had created a plugin that renamed Excerpts to TL;DR.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t surprised when I discoveredÂ <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/too-long-didnt-read/">TL;DR</a>Â created by <a href="http://ozh.org/">Ozh Richard</a>. It hasn&#8217;t been updated in more than two years so it won&#8217;t show up in casual searches.

Pagely, WP Engine, and SiteGround added HHVM hosting options in 2014 and early 2015. However, PHP 7 performance gains have been enough to preclude wider HHVM adoption.</p>\n<p>WordPress core developer John Blackbourn announced yesterday that the project has<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/25/hhvm-no-longer-part-of-wordpress-cores-testing-infrastructure/" target="_blank"> removed HHVM support in the Travis test suite</a> after April 2017 stats showed a mere several dozen WordPress websites running on HHVM. WordPress never officially supported HHVM but Scott Taylor made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27881" target="_blank">many improvements to core for better HHVM compatibility</a> three years ago. Blackbourn clarified on Slack that WordPress is not removing this support but rather will no longer include HHVM in its testing infrastructure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Support for HHVM itself hasn&#8217;t been dropped, but support for testing WordPress on HHVM has been dropped,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;HHVM usage is so minuscule (literally in the dozens according to update stats) that we can&#8217;t warrant the time needed to ensure the test infrastructure works.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The change isn&#8217;t likely to affect too many developers, but it&#8217;s an important milestone that signifies how well PHP 7 has been performing for sites that have switched. Blackbourn suggests those running WordPress on HHVM should consider switching to PHP 7+, as it is &#8220;far more widely supported and tested, and offers all of the memory and performance benefits that HHVM pushed forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The open source MongoDB project also announced yesterday that it will <a href="https://derickrethans.nl/mongodb-hhvm.html" target="_blank">no longer be supporting its HHVM driver</a>, saying it no longer makes good use of contributors&#8217; engineering time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the start of 2015 we began work on an HHVM driver for MongoDB, as part of our project to renew our PHP driver,&#8221; Derick Rethans, MongoDB engineer and author of <a href="http://xdebug.org/" target="_blank">Xdebug</a>, said. &#8220;Back then, HHVM was in its ascendancy and outperforming PHP 5.6 two to one. With such a huge performance difference it was reasonable to assume that many users would be switching over&#8230;With PHP 7 released, we saw very little use of the HHVM driver for MongoDB.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These announcements may be the start of more open source projects giving HHVM compatibility a lower priority. On the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40548" target="_blank">ticket</a> for removing HHVM from the test matrix on Travis, John Blackbourn thanked HHVM for its importance in helping move PHP forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The PHP world owes a lot to HHVM for helping it push it forward,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;Without HHVM, maybe we wouldn&#8217;t have seen such incredible performance gains in PHP 7.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 May 2017 19:07:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: Rainmaker Digital to Partner with Nimble Worldwide";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=70828";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://wptavern.com/rainmaker-digital-to-partner-with-nimble-worldwide";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3341:"<p><a href="http://rainmakerdigital.com/">RainmakerÂ Digital</a>,Â formerly known as Copyblogger Media, has <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/rainmaker-services/">entered intoÂ a letter of intent</a> to partner with <a href="http://www.nimbleworldwide.com/">Nimble Worldwide</a>, a marketing agency based in Dallas, TX.Â Assets from both companies will be combined into a new entity with Rainmaker Digital being the majority owner. Brian Clark, CEO of Rainmaker Digital, says the partnership enables them to transform from a Software as a Service provider to Software and Services.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People need sophisticated marketing technology, yes â but they also need done-for-them services such as design, content, and lead generation strategy,&#8221; Clark said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In that last year, weâve explored several viable ways to do more for our customers and prospects as a hybrid technology and digital marketing service provider. After careful deliberation, weâve come up with a path that allows us to expertly provide anything that a Rainmaker user needs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time both companies have worked together. Prior to <a href="http://rainmakerplatform.com/platform/tour/email/">RainMail</a>, Rainmaker&#8217;s in-house email marketing service, the company used Nimble Worldwide as its email marketing provider. Although the partnership brings in a number of new employees under Rainmaker Digital, Clark admits that they had to let some employees go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This deal provides instant access to an experienced team of digital marketing professionals and a network of talented contractors that ensures our service solutions are expertly crafted and delivered,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;This grows the Rainmaker team significantly, without the pain and uncertainty of building an agency from scratch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The change in business model unfortunately left four of our existing employees without positions, along with the loss of some of our own contractors. That was certainly no fun, and our operations leadership preserved every job possible despite the significant reorganization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Before the end of June, customers will no longer be able to purchase services Ã  la carte. Instead, sales of the platform will be more hands on, bundled with services, and prices will significantly increase. Customers who start a free trial before the end of June will be able to use the platform at a cheaper rate and without the bundled service components.</p>\n<h2>Genesis Framework Remains a Priority</h2>\n<p>StudioPress, Synthesis, Copyblogger, Authority, and DCI are not part of the deal and remain separate entities. Clark says StudioPress sales are going strong and the Genesis Framework is still a priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our Synthesis managed WordPress hosting line will be folded into the StudioPress brand at some point, which shows how much we value StudioPress going forward,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Genesis is still in the hands of Nathan Rice, and he&#8217;s moving it forward at a faster pace than in years past when he had to divide time to work on Rainmaker. Now that he&#8217;s free from that, I&#8217;m excited to see where he takes the framework, which will continue to be a part of Rainmaker as well.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 May 2017 17:24:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: WordPress to Select New JavaScript Framework for Use in Core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=70794";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-select-new-javascript-framework-for-use-in-core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2892:"<p>WordPress core contributors have started collaborating more around their JavaScript efforts this year with regular core-js meetings. One item on the most recent meeting&#8217;s agenda was <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/24/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-23rd/" target="_blank">discussion on choosing a new JavaScript framework for use in core</a> as an alternative to Backbone.</p>\n<p>Contributors began by summarizing the criteria for evaluating framework options, includes factors like stability, longevity, maturity, adoption, accessibility, proven in a WordPress context, and extensibility, among others. Most of the discussion centered on the benefits and drawbacks of React vs Vue.</p>\n<p>The majority of those who participated in the meeting seemed to favor React, as it is already used with several major WordPress projects such as Calypso, Gutenberg, and Jetpack. WordPress&#8217; project lead, Matt Mullenweg, has publicly stated that Automattic is betting on React long-term. Mullenweg has also <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-tech-and-design-leads-for-new-focus-based-development-cycle" target="_blank">expressed a desire for Calypso, or a similar interface, to replace wp-admin</a> in the future. The company has been building its products on React for several years and is pot committed at this point when it comes to the framework.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock">@carlhancock</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/chriswallace">@chriswallace</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros">@mattmedeiros</a> Fair, but React is what us, Facebook, and many others are betting on long-term.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/808698242863165440">December 13, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>WordPress officially adopting a JavaScript framework will likely have a ripple effect that will influence how many products in the ecosystem are built and/or re-written. Proponents of Vue.js find it easy to learn and extend. Those who are advocating for React also cite its extensibility, stability, and its proven use with popular WordPress products.</p>\n<p>Contributors present for the meeting agreed they would be hesitant to commit a new framework to core without using it in some way for a core feature.

It&#8217;s a syndication format similar to RSS and Atom but built with JSON.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The premise was simple: the time is right for a JSON-based approach to feeds,&#8221; Reece said. &#8220;We hope that JSON Feed is straightforward enough to be implemented quickly, and capable enough to push the next decade of blogging software forward. We love RSS too and tried to learn from its success.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://jsonfeed.org/version/1" target="_blank">Version 1</a> of the spec was published last week and the intro includes a very simple example. Publishers can further extend their feeds by creating custom objects.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/json-feed.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The team has also developed a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jsonfeed/" target="_blank">JSON Feed plugin for WordPress</a>, which is now available in the official WordPress Plugin Directory. They are also working on a JSON Feed Parser for Swift.</p>\n<p>If you want to see some example JSON Feeds on the web, check out <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/json" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="http://www.allenpike.com/feed.json" target="_blank">Allen Pike</a>, and <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/blog/feed.json" target="_blank">Flying Meat</a>. Reece&#8217;s Micro.blog project also supports JSON Feed for its Twitter-like <a href="https://micro.blog/feeds/manton.json" target="_blank">timeline</a>.</p>\n<h3>JSON Feed Creators Want to Inspire More Developers to Create Apps for the Open Web</h3>\n<p>Reece and Simmons decided the time was right to build an updated syndication format, as more and more developers are refusing to work with XML.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe that developers (particularly Mac and iOS developers, the group I know best) are so loath to work with XML that they wonât even consider building software that needs an XML parser,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;Which says to me that JSON Feed is needed for the survival of syndication.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In an <a href="http://www.therunloop.com/4" target="_blank">interview</a> on the The Run Loop podcast, Simmons attributed the decline in open web development to developers&#8217; growing aversion for working with XML, which always has problems with character encoding. Many developers find JSON to be easier to use and less buggy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It has kind of made me sad these past five or ten years where it seems like development for the open web has slowed down a lot, particularly when we talk about the intersection of the Mac desktop and the open web,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;There just isn&#8217;t that much going on. I realized that one of the reasons is that people really hate XML and will go out of their way to avoid it. If they see XML APIs or XML stuff they&#8217;re not interested. That&#8217;s yucky, old, weird, hard stuff. But everyone likes JSON, all the cool APIs are JSON, even the not cool APIs are JSON. Everyone uses JSON.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Simmons said he is hopeful that the existence of JSON Feed will inspire developers to build new things for the open web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m hoping to see is that particularly Mac and iOS developers will consider doing new and innovative stuff on the open web, rather than writing yet another Twitter client or something that does something with Facebook. I want to see apps that do something with data that is not stored in somebody&#8217;s silos. I&#8217;m sick of corporate ownership of our data and of what I look at.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that Simmons decided to partner with Reece, who built <a href="https://micro.blog/" target="_blank">micro.blog</a> out of similar convictions regarding the open web. They worked together on the project since February and recruited a dozen different peers to review the specification before launching last week. Now that version 1 is published, its creators hope JSON Feed will make its way into other parts of the web and applications.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m hoping is that this is part of a bigger thing,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;The idea is to revitalize interest in the open web, in blogging, in syndication, and all of that kind of stuff.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Feed Readers are Beginning to Add Support for JSON Feed</h3>\n<p>Initial reactions to JSON Feed have been mixed. Many proponents wonder why it has taken so long for something like this to emerge, but critics ask why the web needs yet another syndication format. A few common criticisms on Hacker News that echo the sentiments of many who oppose the idea:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;We don&#8217;t really need another syndication format that no reader is going to support or support well for years.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14361977" target="_blank">@oefrha</a></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to make a new feed format in 2017, I&#8217;m sorry but copying what came before it and throwing it into JSON just isn&#8217;t enough.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14362286" target="_blank">@russellbeattie</a></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;One has to wonder whether Simmons is just trying to revive the old RSS ecosystem. &#8220;What do developers like these days, JSON? Let&#8217;s do RSS in JSON!&#8221; &#8230; This does not help. The real challenge these days is to replicate the solutions Facebook and Twitter brought to feeds (bi-directionality and data-retention in particular) in a decentralized manner that could actually become popular. Simply replicating RSS in the data-format du jour is not going to achieve that.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14363784" target="_blank">@toyg</a></p>\n<p>Despite critics, feed readers are already starting to add support for JSON Feed. The good news for publishers is that they don&#8217;t have to abandon their RSS feeds. Publishers can add support for JSON Feed alongside their existing feeds.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="https://json-feed-viewer.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">JSON Feed Viewer app</a> is built on top of JSON Feed. <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/post/160982162270/newsblur-now-supports-the-new-json-feed-spec" target="_blank">NewsBlur announced support</a> for the spec this week, along with <a href="http://blog.inoreader.com/2017/05/announcing-json-feed-support.html" target="_blank">Inoreader</a>, <a href="https://betamagic.nl/blog.html" target="_blank">News Explorer</a>, and <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2017/05/22/feedbin-supports-json-feed/" target="_blank">Feedbin</a>.</p>\n<p>Ben Ubois, founder of Feedbin, addressed one of the most common criticisms that feed readers aren&#8217;t likely to add support for the new JSON Feed spec because of the prevalence of RSS:</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the criticisms Iâve seen of JSON Feed is that thereâs no incentive for feed readers to support JSON Feed,&#8221; Ubois said. &#8220;This is not true. One of the largest-by-volume support questions I get is along the lines of &#8216;Why does this random feed not work?&#8217; And, 95% of the time, itâs because the feed is broken in some subtle way. JSON Feed will help alleviate these problems, because itâs easier to get right.&#8221;</p>\n<p>JSON Feed also has a few additional features that existing formats don&#8217;t offer as easily. Simmons highlighted a few graphics-related features in his <a href="http://www.therunloop.com/4" target="_blank">interview</a> with The Run Loop podcast:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For instance, when you define an author, you can provide a URL of an avatar image. You can imagine someone doing kind of a Twitter-like view of a feed with avatars for different posts. It also has support for things like the URL of the featured image or banner image that you can specify for an article and your RSS reader can format it somewhat like it would look like if you had actually gone to the web page with the banner image in the background. It has a way to specify fav icons and a larger icon for your feed, which right now news readers have to guess what your favicon is or scrape the homepage looking for the metadata tag that says where it is. They have to make all these additional requests to find out some of the basic graphics about your feed or about the article and that stuff is all specified inside the JSON feed. People who actually use those get a much nicer interface on the reading side.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dave Winer <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/09/10/rssInJsonForReal.html" target="_blank">experimented with the idea of JSONified RSS in 2012</a>, but it didn&#8217;t catch on. His <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/21/reEvanWilliamsAndJsonFeed.html" target="_blank">reaction to the new JSON Feed spec</a> is &#8220;pretty neutral, kind of a shoulder shrug.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If developers have a hard time using XML in their apps, if that&#8217;s the problem, why not attack it right there?&#8221; Winer said. &#8220;Work to make it easier. I work in Node and the browser, and in both places XML and JSON are equally easy to use. The same could be done for any environment. In fact in the browser, XML is integrated deeply into the programming model, because the web is made out of XML.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In contrast, John Gruber thinks it&#8217;s the right time for the project and didn&#8217;t hesitate to add a JSON feed for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/json" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a>. He is eagerly supporting the JSON Feed project and is closely monitoring its adoption, publishing links to all the apps and feed readers that have already added support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this is a great idea, and a good spec,&#8221; Gruber said. &#8220;I even like the style in which the spec is written: for real humans (much like the RSS spec). If you want to see a real-life example, Daring Fireball has a JSON Feed. Iâve got a good feeling about this project â the same sort of feeling I had about Markdown back in the day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With the momentum from quick adoption by smaller news readers, JSON Feed has the potential to revive news syndication if some of the larger ones add support. Developers may even be more inspired to create new feed readers, given the ease of implementing the new spec.</p>\n<p>Manton Reece said that if JSON Feed had come along when blogging was at its peak, when there were fewer problems, he thinks there would have been less of a pressing feeling that the web needs a new syndication format.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m amazed with the traction it&#8217;s gotten,&#8221; Manton Reece said in a recent <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2017/05/episode-283-reset-all-the-things/" target="_blank">interview</a> on the Core Intuition podcast. &#8220;Of course some people will be negative about it and some people won&#8217;t like it. We certainly expected a lot of pushback on it. Everybody knows we need this, but it&#8217;s daunting. Who is going to try to push something like this when there are millions of RSS feeds? It feels like why even bother, it&#8217;s impossible. But things change over time and I think this is important enough and blogging is important enough that it&#8217;s worth making the investment now. Tomorrow the web is not going to be any different, but over time it might be a little different. Everybody knows that we need something like this but there hasn&#8217;t been something everybody could get behind until now.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 May 2017 17:51:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 274 â WordPress Commercials, Storefront, and the Customizer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=70802&preview=true&preview_id=70802";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-274-wordpress-commercials-storefront-and-the-customizer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2278:"<p>In this episode, <a href="https://jjj.blog/">John James Jacoby</a> joins me to discuss the news of the week.

It took me a day writing this essay as I wish I could write my whole mind in it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>âStart where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. â Arthur Asheâ</p></blockquote>\n<h3>So, hereâs the start I had:</h3>\n<p>From my childhood, Iâve been wondering about Software Technologies. I always wondered about the constructions of website, and a program. It was the time when my mother <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yogita.patil.18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yogita</a>, just introduced me Google, the God of websites! All the curiosity I had was strengthened when using Google.</p>\n<p>Do you know what shaped my career? A search string on Google which said âHow to make a websiteâ! Not much useful, but the slow start I had was everything I need. That was 2012. (Me, 8 yrs old) When I tried an online web designing tool named SimDif. Just then, I got to know Weebly. I made my first permanent website, <a href="http://mathsbuzzz.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mathsbuzzz.weebly.com</a> and the curiosity went deeper.</p>\n<p>Now I thought of making a website myself, with no tool, with real programming! That was 2013. At that time, Microsoft Frontpage was nearly coming to an end of popularity. I embraced it. Though it couldnât be called programming, but I liked it as I went one step further.</p>\n<p>I also learnt a bit of HTML from a book I had at home. Itâs not even half of the story Iâm telling. The time I was introduced to WordPress is much further. Thatâs 2016.</p>\n<h3>What in 2015?</h3>\n<p>I had a course of advanced HTML/CSS in 2015 where I got to know completely about Framing, Coding and Publishing a website. Then, I practiced it a lot and then thought about putting a step forward to PHP.</p>\n<h3>Itâs 2016</h3>\n<p>Summer vacations were to get over and I had a course of PHP. Thereâs where I came to know about the REAL PROGRAMMING. I started making my first coded website and it was completely published in September 2015. It was my motherâs online store. And then, from November 2016, I made another website and completed the project in February 2016. That was my first blog, IQubex.com made with simple HTML/CSS and no PHP.</p>\n<p>I was actually equipped with HTML/CSS knowledge and was practicing PHP. But, I never got what I dreamt of. I dreamt of: âMy exposure in Web Developing World. A community, which will help me in my needs. People, who will encourage me.â</p>\n<p>Dream became true.</p>\n<h3>When WordPress Came In My Life</h3>\n<p>Its still 2016, when striked an article in Newspaper about WordCamp Nashik 2016. My mother read it and thought that it would prove like a miracle for me. It was the start of October 2016. Nashik is my city and so it was always easy for me to attend WordCamp Nashik.</p>\n<p>It was for developers, bloggers and all the people who maintained their interest in Web Technologies. I knew that I too fit in that category.</p>\n<h3>Now came, 16th October 2016</h3>\n<p>We all know how cool experiences we get in a WordCamp. But this was the best for me as it was the first WordCamp of my life. From then, I migrated my blog to WordPress and got everything better. I saw how people program for WordPress and how big is the WordPress world.</p>\n<p>So, what did I miss? Nothing. I got a helping community. I got nice friends. I got people who are much more experienced and their knowledge which will help me throughout the life. What more? The best thing I received is Motivation.</p>\n<p>I used to write less on my blog as it was not equipped with PHP and was basic HTML/CSS. Due to that, I uploaded articles every now and then. But after the arrival of WordPress in my life, I wrote frequent articles, more beautifully, with more customization and with more interest. Then progressed my blog!</p>\n<h3>What next?</h3>\n<p>It was WordCamp Pune 2017 where I became the youngest speaker of WordCamp. I had an interview with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rahul286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rahul Bansal</a> Sir. He met me at WordCamp Nashik. So, I was able to talk in front of people. This is how my confidence got a boost positively.</p>\n<p>Now I run more than 3 websites and constructing more. I also developed a plugin on WordPress. Learning about making theme. Iâm also aiming to be a good developer in future. After all, there is a lot of time left. Iâm 13 yrs old.</p>\n<p>So, simply saying, before WordPress I was unaware of what I have to do in future, and now I can see the complete scene of my future career. Thanks to WordPress and its Community.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: My Life, Designed by WordPress!" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=My%20Life%2C%20Designed%20by%20WordPress%21&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Flife-designed-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: My Life, Designed by WordPress!" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Flife-designed-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Flife-designed-wordpress%2F&title=My+Life%2C+Designed+by+WordPress%21" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: My Life, Designed by WordPress!"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/life-designed-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/052417-150x150.jpg&description=My Life, Designed by WordPress!" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: My Life, Designed by WordPress!"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/life-designed-wordpress/" title="My Life, Designed by WordPress!"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/life-designed-wordpress/">My Life, Designed by WordPress!</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 May 2017 11:00:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Kumar Abhirup";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8 Improves Accessibility on Admin Screens";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=70701";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"https://wptavern.com/-improves-accessibility-on-admin-screens";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2474:"<p>In WordPress 4.3, the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/">Accessibility Team</a> <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/">restored&nbsp;H1 headings</a> to&nbsp;the admin screens. This paved the way for the team to change the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/headings-hierarchy-changes-in-the-admin-screens/">headings hierarchy</a>&nbsp;in WordPress 4.4. In WordPress 4.8, admin screens are more accessible&nbsp;thanks to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/17/cleaner-headings-in-the-admin-screens/">organizing the header text</a> on pages.</p>\n<p>The headers on admin screens typically contain more than text. For example,&nbsp;the Add New button on the Posts and Pages admin screens is included within the Posts and Pages header text.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>This makes it difficult for assistive technologies to help users navigate different sections of a page. The changes in WordPress 4.8 turn the headings on admin screens into their own elements.</p>\n<p>Before WordPress 4.8 the HTML looked like this:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;h1&gt;<br />\n    Posts<br />\n    &lt;a href="... /post-new.php" class="page-title-action"&gt;Add New&lt;/a&gt;<br />\n&lt;/h1&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Now it looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;h1 class="wp-heading-inline"&gt;Posts&lt;/h1&gt;<br />\n&lt;a href="... /post-new.php" class="page-title-action"&gt;Add New&lt;/a&gt;<br />\n&lt;hr class="wp-header-end"&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Andrea Fercia, WordPress core committer and a member of the accessibility team, explains what theme and plugin authors need to know.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If your plugin or theme follows the previous WordPress pattern of adding extraneous content to the main heading, please update your plugin or theme to make the heading cleaner,&#8221; Fercia said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All you need to do is move the extraneous content outside of the heading. WordPress 4.8 ships with new CSS rules to take care of the new markup structure and in most cases, no additional changes will be required.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These improvements are <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26601">three years</a> in the making. After much discussion and being punted to future releases, Fercia says the Accessibility team decided to handle the changes in smaller commits versus one large patch. This provided the necessary momentum to get the changes in core.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 May 2017 04:33:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: Cape Town to Host 4th Annual WordPress Charity Hackathon on July 15";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=70558";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"https://wptavern.com/cape-town-to-host-4th-annual-wordpress-charity-hackathon-on-july-15";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3777:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cape-town-charity-hackathon-2017.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Cape Town will be hosting its <a href="https://doaction.org/event/cape-town-2017/" target="_blank">fourth annual do_action WordPress Charity Hackathon</a> on July 15 this year. The objective of the event is to build websites for 10 different non-profit organizations in one day, an ambitious endeavor that requires a mix of different web and marketing talents working in highly concentrated teams. Participants help non-profits kick start their websites so the organizations can focus on doing what they do best &#8211; helping the local community.</p>\n<p>Hugh Lashbrooke, who is leading the organization of the event again this year, said the team has secured a new venue that will be better suited to a hackathon. <a href="http://workshop17.co.za/" target="_blank">Workshop17</a>, a collaboration and meeting venue, will host the charity hackathon&#8217;s 70 participants (7 people per team). The event is currently half-full and is recruiting another 35 participants.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing the event has done for me, and others in the community, is open us up to the rest of what is happening in the city,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;Our skills may seem pretty self-serving (building websites to make money), but they can be used for a lot more. Everyone who participates has so much fun on the day that I think they forget that it&#8217;s really work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s charities include the following organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tygerberg Association for Persons with Physical Disabilities</li>\n<li>Kidz Adventure Camp</li>\n<li>Little Lambs Christian Day Care</li>\n<li>Iliso Care Society</li>\n<li>Daughters Of Destiny</li>\n<li>Durbanville Children&#8217;s Home</li>\n<li>The Homestead Projects for Street Children</li>\n<li>Usiko Stellenbosch</li>\n<li>Rotary Club of Constantia</li>\n<li>ASSITEJ South Africa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cape Town WordPress community pioneered the concept of using WordPress to lift up local charities and this type of event has now spread to other areas of the world. As a member of the WordPress project&#8217;s Community Team, Lashbrooke has been working on making the do_action charity hackathons easily reproducible. It&#8217;s now part of the WordPress Community Program with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/" target="_blank">guidelines in the community events organizer handbook</a>.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="http://doaction.org" target="_blank">doaction.org</a> website lists the upcoming hackathons and takes care of all the manual admin work that Lashbrooke did for himself for the first couple of events. The functionality is built on top of his experience in running the events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There has been a ton of interest in the event from communities around the world, and we&#8217;ve already seen successful events in Austin and Johannesburg,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;More hackathons are scheduled for Pretoria, Beirut, and Montreal later this year. A few of the other cities that have shown interest and applied, but have not scheduled anything yet, are Fort Myers, Denver, New York City, and Ahmedabad, amongst others.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bringing the do_action charity hackathons under the official WordPress community program allows the team to offer logistical and financial support to organizers in the same way they already support WordCamp and meetup organizers. They do not have an official mentorship program set up yet, as the event types is still new, but Lashbrook said the community team does what it can to help hackathon organizers get started.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 May 2017 19:52:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"Matt: Whatâs in My Bag, 2017 edition";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47340";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://ma.tt/2017/05/whats-in-my-bag-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19635:"<p>I am a road warrior who has racked up several million miles over the past decade, and since I&#8217;m also working more-than-full-time running <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> (a totally distributed company) and leading <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> I need the ability to be productive wherever I can find a comfortable place to sit.

They connect via bluetooth to your phone and can notify you when you leave them behind, or use the app to locate them. A charge lasts 30 days.

Hat tip: Jony.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E3SNO1G/?tag=photomatt08-20">Bose QuietComfort 35</a>, wireless bluetooth headphones. I misplaced my <a href="https://ma.tt/2015/04/best-headphones-spring-2015-edition/">cool WordPress Sennheisers</a> and picked these up in an airport before a long flight. They&#8217;re extremely comfortable, great battery life, and I keep an audio splitter and Lightning audio adapter in the case. I&#8217;ve hated on Bose many times in the past, but these are decent and I get why people like them, especially the comfort aspect. I am listening to them as I write this. I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FE8VM8Q/?tag=photomatt08-20">Audeze EL-8 Titanium</a> for a while, which obviously sound better, but the lightning cable was unwieldy and it was annoying (and ridiculous) I couldn&#8217;t plug them into my laptop. Hat tip: Every airport electronics store.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161D1CL0/?tag=photomatt08-20">Jabra Sport Pace bluetooth earbuds</a>, which replaced my Powerbeats for running and working out. They have been way sturdier. Pretty inexpensive, too, right now about $60.Â I know in theory you can run with Airpods, but I&#8217;d be too scared of one going down a street drain.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.carbonfiberdesigns.com/Carbon-Fiber-Money-Clip.html">Cool carbon fiber money clip</a>, which I use to hold a little cash for places like street vendors that don&#8217;t take credit cards, or if I&#8217;m in another country and need to carry around currency. The site is a little sketchy, they should upgrade to <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>. Also pictured: The <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/EasyPayXpress.htm">EasyPay XPress NYC Metro Card</a>, which is super handy in New York as it auto-refills.

Hat tip: Lululemon Lab in Vancouver.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MRWWV6S/?tag=photomatt08-20">Fidget spinner</a>, I think this one is from Amazon. Try one of these if you haven&#8217;t yet, they&#8217;re surprisingly addictive. If you go over to 14 on the left you&#8217;ll see a custom metal one a friend made for me. Hat tips: Zach and Xa.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016QO5YNG/?tag=photomatt08-20">Apple Magic Mouse 2</a>. A classic. (3rd year)</li>\n<li>This is the latest <a href="https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-bags/Para-Backpack/_/prod8260286?rcnt=2&N=8av&cnt=7&color=LM9Y11S_0001">Lululemon Para backpack</a>, and unlike last year&#8217;s Cruiser it&#8217;s currently available in stores and online. I dig this iteration: it has a little less padding on the shoulders, but the big front zipper pocket is super handy and in general it&#8217;s a lot more streamlined and water resistant. Om clued me in <a href="https://www.aersf.com/fit-pack-00006">to a similar one from Aer</a>, I don&#8217;t know who designed it first. Hat tip: Rose.</li>\n<li>So&#8230; there are two laptops, a custom prototype 13&#8243; Automattic-logo Macbook touchbar, and the stickered 15&#8243;. I generally only travel with one of these, the 13&#8243; for shorter trips or the 15&#8243; if I&#8217;m going to be on the road for more than a few weeks. The performance is just better on the 15&#8243;. My favorite things about both are the 4 USB-C ports, that you can charge on any of them, and the Touch ID. (Automatticians after 4 years of tenure can get a custom Macbook, which we now offer with the WordPress, Automattic, or Jetpack logo. I usually get the test ones to make sure the quality is up to snuff.) I carry around the larger 87W brick from the 15&#8243;, and keep the extension cable now so it&#8217;s easier to plug in on those weak plugs on planes.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016381AHE/?tag=photomatt08-20">Kindle Oasis</a>. I still love the Kindle. I&#8217;ve started listening to audiobooks this year and the integration with Audible is cool. The Oasis is great because of the real buttons and the fact that you can flip it to hold in either hand, but it&#8217;s been the most annoying model in a few generations because the screen brightness isn&#8217;t adaptive, and it gives &#8220;low battery&#8221; warnings when the extra battery cover is low but the actual device is not, which seems to defeat the purpose. Great form factor and ergonomics though.</li>\n<li>Passport, because you never know when you&#8217;ll need to leave the country.</li>\n<li>A pocket-sized <a href="https://www.baronfig.com/">Baron Fig</a> notebook, which I use in meetings to avoid my phone. Hat tip: Rose.</li>\n<li><a href="https://madeby.google.com/phone/">Google Pixel</a>. Best Android phone I&#8217;ve used, uses USB-C which I love, I love the size. I use this mostly for testing and staying current on Android, or as a backup. I use <a href="https://fi.google.com/">Google Fi</a> for service on this one.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DOJDTQ0/?tag=photomatt08-20">Forerunner 735, charger, and heart rate strap</a>. I actually <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XGD6CS4/?tag=photomatt08-20">switched to the 935</a> since this picture was taken, but my notes apply to both. (Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/03/garmin-forerunner-935-depth-review.html">a great review of the new 935</a>.) Garmin makes the best fitness smartwatches in the world right now. Aspects are clunky: the app is not the most elegant, the add-on watch faces and such leave something to be desired, the sleep tracking is way worse than Fitbit, and there is no fine-grained control over notifications. That said, the battery life goes 8-10 days (!) so I often don&#8217;t even bring the charger when I travel. The stats are unparalleled especially for running. It&#8217;s waterproof and can also track swimming and biking. Finally my favorite feature: the screen is always on. I know that sounds basic, but I have been driven crazy by years of Fitbit and Apple Watch require tapping or wrist gesticulations just to see the time. (Extra awkward in a meeting.) My hardcore fitness friends love this one too.

Hat tip Esther, Naoko, and my mom.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O5JARCI/?tag=photomatt08-20">Belkin car mount</a>, really handy when renting a car and navigating around. (3rd year)</li>\n<li>This is a more-expensive but not-better version of what I had last year, which I&#8217;ll quote and actually recommend:Â &#8220;This is probably the least-travel-friendly thing I travel with, but the utility isÂ so great I put up with it. It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D4LBOV6/?tag=photomatt08-20">Sennheiser Culture Series Wideband Headset</a>, which I use for podcasts, Skype, Facetime, Zoom, and Google Hangout calls with external folks and teams inside of Automattic. Light, comfortable, great sound quality, and great at blocking out background noise so you don&#8217;t annoy other people on the call. Worth the hassle.&#8221; I leave the USB-C adapter attached to this. Cable still annoys me.</li>\n<li>iPhone 7 Plus, on Verizon, with a <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/phone-case-3-card/i7plus/caramel">Bellroy 3-card case</a>. If you&#8217;re a guy I highly recommend trying out a phone wallet case, it&#8217;s a game-changer to only have one thing to keep track of and not having a wallet in your back pocket is good to avoid getting misaligned. I have three cards in it, an Amex, a Visa, and my drivers license. In NYC I also squeeze in the Metrocard. Hat tip: Craig (a previous Bellroy model).</li>\n<li>The Japanese company <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TES88NK/?tag=photomatt08-20">Maruman makes this awesome grid-paper lie-flat notebook</a>, which I fill and occasionally draw in. I love this thing, and having a work area where I can have my laptop, mouse, iPad, and this notebook all set up next to each other is my happy place. The paper is soft.

I didn&#8217;t expect to, but I really love this device. It gives me way more joy than my phone or my laptops. Gorgeous screen, long battery life, always connect, I can tether to it, write on it with the pen in 32, the keyboard is fast and silent, split screen is handy&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how to describe it. Like the Airpods, this product just excels in every area. I still have and need to use a laptop, but it&#8217;s less of my day and mostly because of some internal tools and security stuff we have.</li>\n<li>I ended up with this beast <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C316EIK/?tag=photomatt08-20">Cable Matters USB-c mega-dongle to cover ethernet, VGA, HDMI, and old USB</a>.

This might not make the cut next year as the Airpods are pretty good, but if I&#8217;m going to be on a regular (non-Facetime) phone or conference call for a few hours, this is what I turn to.

I&#8217;m also currently testing out the <a href="http://www.choosemuse.com/">assisted meditation device The Muse</a>, but it hasn&#8217;t really stuck yet and I usually just turn to <a href="https://calm.com/">Calm</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ensuring network continuity:</strong> One thing you&#8217;ll notice is the iPhone is on Verizon, which has the best network in the US, the iPad is on AT&amp;T, and the Pixel is on Google Fi. This allows me to have a diversity of network access which is occasionally handy in the US and has saved my butt a few times when overseas. Whichever device has the best connection I&#8217;ll just tether the others to it. I almost never join coffee shop or hotel wifi these days, a good LTE connection is usually better.</p>\n<h3>USB-C Is Why We Can&#8217;t Have Nice Things</h3>\n<p>Oh, USB-C, I love you. You&#8217;re reversible, fast, and work for everything, like I can charge my laptop with almost anything, and many new devices like Google Wifi use you for power. The dangerous cable on Amazon thing seems to have worked itself out, and having 4 ports on the laptop is amazing, I can charge everything I need off it. But as you can see from the mess of cables and how many other legacy USB things I&#8217;m carrying around, we&#8217;re (still!) in this really awkward in-between phase for computing. First, there are no good retractable cables, especially ones that have USB-C on one end and Lightning or Micro-USB on the other. I wish my headset, headphones, sunglasses, and Kindle didn&#8217;t need Micro-USB, and I wish the Airpods, iPhone, iPad Pro, Magic Mouse would just give up on Lightning and support USB-C instead. But we&#8217;re in this liminal space, and the number one thing I hope is better by next year&#8217;s post is that the USB-C accessory world has flourished and I just have a couple of neat retractable USB-C cables and things like the battery, wall charger, and car charger in 34, 35, and 37 just have all USB-C ports. A boy can dream, right?</p>\n<h3>In Closing</h3>\n<p>Partly because the backpack is a little smaller, I&#8217;ve really tried to streamline and a lot of things from last year, like a small digital camera, the Chromecasts, travel router, etc I don&#8217;t bother carrying around in my backpack anymore. I hope these can get simpler and shorter every year. I tagged these with an affiliate ID for Amazon this year but mostly just to see if anyone actually buys stuff from these posts. I walk millions of steps a year with my backpack and wouldn&#8217;t carry something around unless I really believed in it, which is also why I&#8217;m always testing and trying new things. As you can tell a lot of this kit has evolved from recommendations, so if you have any please leave a note in the comments. I&#8217;ve also considered doing something similar for shoes, clothes, apps, suitcases, or toiletries, so holler if you&#8217;d like any of those.Â Alrighty, that&#8217;s it until next year!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 May 2017 17:05:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe to Halt Regular Ticket Sales May 31, Fewer than 400 Tickets Remain";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=70556";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-to-halt-regular-ticket-sales-may-31-fewer-than-400-tickets-remain";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2074:"<p>WordCamp Europe organizers will be <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/05/22/wceu-regular-ticket-sales-to-end-on-may-31st" target="_blank">ending regular ticket sales on May 31</a>. The event has sold out well in advance in previous years, but the logistics of managing a budget for an estimated 3,000 attendees prompted organizers to opt for ending ticket sales two weeks before the event:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As WordCamp Europe is a community event, we have to be extra careful with every penny thatâs spent.

Even on widescreen monitors, the Customizer sidebar is only 300px wide.</p>\n<p>This limitation was one of the motivating factors behind the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-pane-resizer/">Customize Pane Resizer</a> feature plugin <a href="https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-feature-plugin-lets-users-resize-the-customizer-pane">created in 2015</a>.

I use a 21 inch widescreen monitor and the width of the sidebar on my screen is 345px.</p>\n<img />345 Pixel Wide Customizer Sidebar\n<p>While not a huge change, the extra width is noticeable. WordPress theme and plugin developers who have built custom controls into the Customizer are highly encouraged to test WordPress 4.8 to ensure that they display properly on large screens.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Custom controls in plugins and themes should utilize alternative approaches to doing layout than using pixel widths,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Use of percentage-based widths or flexbox will help ensure that controls will <em>appear properly in larger displays</em>, while also making controls <em>future-compatible</em> when the sidebar width could be user-resizable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to be able to adjust the width of the sidebar, check out theÂ <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-pane-resizer">Customize Pane Resizer</a> plugin.

The release has been more than five months in the making since planning began in early December 2016.</p>\n<p>Storefront 2.2.0 focuses on improving the new user experience. Getting all of the right widgets and design settings in place to set up a new store has been a challenge for users in the past. This release introduces a new setup and configuration wizard in the Cusotmizer that takes advantage of WordPress 4.7âs Starter Content feature. If the user is starting with a fresh store, the wizard will automatically import example products, create the homepage and set the correct template, assign the &#8216;full width&#8217; template to the cart and checkout pages, and remove unnecessary widgets.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/storefront-setup-wizard.png?ssl=1"><img /></a>Storefront setup wizard in the Customozer\n<p>This release also brings an overall design refresh that includes a new homepage hero section. The Storefront development team replaced the theme&#8217;s previous dark header background with a white one in order to put the focus on product images and improve the appearance of site logos. This small but important change gives the theme an overall lighter look and will be important for child themes to account for in their styles.</p>\n<p>Storefront 2.2 also adds subtle changes to typography, font weights, and button styles for a more minimalist, less-opinionated base design.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/storefront-design-refresh.png?ssl=1"><img /></a>Storefront design refresh\n<p>These changes are in line with what Matt Mullenweg said about Storefront when we interviewed him in December. He said Storefront was due for a design update and has a lot of potential for improvement.</p>\n<p>âWith the Storefront theme thereâs actually a lot we can do there to make it look like a really cool store out of the box, much like the default themes in WordPress,â Mullenweg said. âPart of the reason we change them every year is what was cool in 2012 is not cool in 2017. Fashions change, trends change. I think Woo should evolve Storefront in the same way. Thereâs kind of a look for independent stores right now. Theyâve got a certain vibe. Letâs make it easy to do that vibe, so that you donât have to be on Etsy or Amazon or one of the e-commerce monoliths to keep people coming to you and supporting your product.â</p>\n<p>Whereas many Storefront users had to opt for a child theme in order to have a more product-focused homepage in the past, the design and user experience improvements in the 2.2.0 release make the theme a more compelling option for use by itself.</p>\n<p>There are <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/" target="_blank">more than 90,000 stores using Storefront</a> as a base for their sites WordPress.org lists eight child themes using Storefront as a parent and WooCommerce.com also has a directory of <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/" target="_blank">free and commercial child themes</a>. This major release will likely affect all stores using these themes in one way or another. To avoid any surprise design updates, the WooCommerce team recommends that users test version 2.2.0 in a development environment before updating.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 22 May 2017 20:13:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Boarding Wrong Flight";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47325";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"https://ma.tt/2017/05/boarding-wrong-flight/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:567:"<p>The Economist writes <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2017/05/where-am-i?fsrc=gnews">about who&#8217;s wrong when flyers end up in the wrong cities</a>.

Being Canadian, they were exceedingly nice and asked me to stay on the flight but they&#8217;d find me one from Toronto to Montreal after I landed.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 21 May 2017 22:45:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"Matt: IBM Goes Non-Remote";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47342";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"https://ma.tt/2017/05/ibm-goes-non-remote/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1784:"<p>Like Yahoo a few years ago, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-a-pioneer-of-remote-work-calls-workers-back-to-the-office-1495108802">IBM, an early pioneer of distributed work, is calling workers back to the office</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The shift is particularly surprising since the Armonk, N.Y., company has been among the business worldâs staunchest boosters of remote work, both for itself and its customers. IBM markets software and services for what it calls âthe anytime, anywhere workforce,â and its researchers have published numerous studies on the merits of remote work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If &#8220;IBM has boasted that more than 40% of employees worked outside traditional company offices&#8221; and they currently have 380,000 employees (wow), then that&#8217;s 152k people on the market.</p>\n<p>As I said when Yahoo did the same, it&#8217;s hard to judge this from the outside. A company that was happy about how they&#8217;re doing wouldn&#8217;t make a shift this big or this suddenly. It&#8217;s very possible the way distributed folks were interacting with their in-office teams wasn&#8217;t satisfactory, especially if they were forced to use subpar in-house tools like SameTime instead of Zoom or Skype. Yahoo didn&#8217;t have the best trajectory after they made a similar move, and hopefully IBM isn&#8217;t going to follow the same path.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Automattic and <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/companies-hiring-remote-workers/">many other companies</a> are hiring. If you aren&#8217;t going to work in a company&#8217;s headquarters, it is probably safest to work at a company that is fully distributed (no second tier for people not at HQ) rather than be one of a few &#8220;remote&#8221; people at a centralized company.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 20 May 2017 19:21:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"Post Status: WordPress in higher education, with Rachel Cherry â Draft Podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=37073";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-education-rachel-cherry-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2386:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.
